But many of the decisions we care about result from comparisons.↩︎\nIn America, this translates to “Barnes and Noble”.↩︎\nIf only temporarily in some cases.↩︎\nA decent argument for cynicism↩︎\nBefore continuing, it is worth noting that at least two other papers provide compelling and well-specified evidence for the first condition and its impact. “Can Lower(ed) Expert Opinions Lead to Better Consumer Ratings?: The Case of Michelin Stars” by Xingyi Li and colleagues finds that losing Michelin stars has a positive effect on ratings for restaurants. “The Good, the Bad and the Picky: Consumer Heterogeneity and the Reversal of Product Ratings” by Tommaso Bondi, Michelangelo Rossi, and Ryan Stevens finds similarly that people are more critical of movies after they have been nominated for Oscars.↩︎\nSometimes these certifications are influenced by ratings (Superhost status is), sometimes they are not (Heather seems unswayed by the masses), and sometimes it is not clear (eBay’s Top Rated Sellers are a confusing example of this).↩︎\nThe specific assumption we make here is that nothing that influences ratings changes between platforms alongside Superhost status. Because Superhost status is entirely an Airbnb feature, this should be more defensible.↩︎\nAnd another paper, detailed in the next blog post↩︎"
