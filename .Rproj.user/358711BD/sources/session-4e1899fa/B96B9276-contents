## Flexible, Multicore Specification Curve

The popular `specr` package in R is good. However, `specr` is not super flexible---it does not support fixed-effect regressions, and mixed-effect regressions take some work.

I wanted to create a package that would build on `specr` while being more user-friendly. To that end, I'm working on this set of functions, which I've given the bad title of `specster`:

-   [`https://github.com/mattmeist/specster`](https://github.com/mattmeist/specster)

The current code supports:

-   Four common models: OLS Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Fixed-Effect Regression, and Linear Mixed-Effect Regression (i.e., `lm`, `glm`, `lfe::felm`, and `lmerTest::lmer` in R)
-   Setup of models
-   Multicore processing to speed up computation
-   Graphing with `ggplot2`

## Lasso Regression Example

Just an example of Lasso Regression with explanation.\

## Mediation Model Plotting (Work-in-Progress)

This function will draw you a mediation model in `ggplot` in R. It ain't awesome, but mediation is kind of silly anyways.\
I plan to keep adding to it, as it can only do super simple mediation now.
