-   *Published* at Journal of Consumer Research
-   With [Nick Reinholtz](https://reinholtzresearch.com)
-   Platforms often present both user-generated star ratings and certifications---like Airbnb's "Superhost" badge---to signal quality. We find that quality certifications negatively influence ratings, in ways regular consumers do not correct for. Across over 1.5 million ratings and several follow-up studies, certified properties receive lower subsequent ratings. Troublingly, consumers do not correct for this when choosing properties to stay at.

### Quality in Context: Evidence That Consumption Context Influences User-Generated Product Ratings

-   *Conditionally accepted* at Journal of Marketing
-   With [Nick Reinholtz](https://reinholtzresearch.com)
-   This paper examines how situational context---like weather---affects user-generated product ratings. Analyzing over 218,000 ratings from REI.com, we find that cold-weather gear receives lower ratings during unseasonably cold weather, despite being designed for those conditions. Other products are not affected. Follow-up experiments show that consumers consistently overlook how context shapes their experiences, and this bias proves difficult to correct.

### Consumers Believe Star Ratings are Comparable Even When They are Not

-   Under review at Journal of Experimental Psychology: General
-   With [Nick Reinholtz](https://reinholtzresearch.com)
-   This research questions at a more fundamental level whether user-generated star ratings help consumers make optimal choices. We show that ratings are influenced by the expectations a product creates, making them context-dependent and often incomparable across alternatives. Using four experiments, we find that higher expectations lead to lower ratings, and that consumers *can* mistakenly prefer higher-rated products even when they are objectively worse.

### Opening Up About Money: The Unexpected Benefits of Financial Communication

-   *Conditionally accepted* at Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes
-   With [Joe Gladstone](https://www.joegladstone.com) and [Emily Garbinsky](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eng26/) 
-   This research finds that talking about money can reduce financial anxiety. Using experiments, large-scale surveys, and text analysis of online discussions, we find that communicating about finances---especially controllable topics like budgeting---significantly lowers anxiety. The effect is strongest when people feel a greater sense of control, such as when communicating online, suggesting financial communication is a scalable tool for improving well-being.

### The Dispersion Between Forecasts changes How People Combine Them

-   Under review at Management Science
-   With [Katie Mehr](https://www.katie-mehr.com)
-   This research explores how the dispersion between advisors' estimates affects whether people average their advice. When advisor estimates are similar, people are more likely to average them---but when estimates differ, people revert to their own prior beliefs and rely on advice less. This suggests people misinterpret disagreement as advisor incompetence, failing to recognize that averaging can reduce noise and improve accuracy.

### People Prefer Critics, Consumers Prefer Peers: Differences in Reliance on Peer and Critic Evaluations by Domain

-   Under review at Psychological Science
-   With [Katie Mehr](https://www.katie-mehr.com)
-   This research investigates when people rely more on peers versus experts for advice. Across five preregistered studies, we find that people turn to peers for experience-based evaluations (like product ratings) and to experts for information-based predictions (like weather forecasts). This distinction arises because people view peers as more similar in experience and experts as better at interpreting information.
