There’s a mildew smell on the air mixed with the many spices of everyone’s dinner. With no air conditioning or fan you have to sleep with the windows open, but the street noise is bad. The front door is an iron behemoth that shakes the whole place with a boom every time it closes. The good: convenient location and good communication"

The location is good, specially if you have a car. Heads-up, don’t park on the side walk. Although we parked exactly where Lily told us, we got a parking ticket."

The bathroom and showers were always clean and its location right outside of Chinatown was so convenient. The front desk was very accommodating and helpful with the check-in and check-out process, even offering to hold our bags for a few hours for the latter. The surrounding area generally felt safe, with my partner and I taking walks around the area until 9-10pm. Great experience overall! Highly recommend, especially given its location."

They've put a lot of thought into the suite, and have kitted it out with everything a traveler could need (and might not have).

The place is fully renovated and looks brand new just like in the photos. If you are sensitive to road noise, suggest you bring earplugs as it is in the city close to the 101 freeway. It did not bother us and we found the place answered our needs. Vincent was very helpful and communicative."

Used earplugs at night for outdoor noise, which was expected, and didn't have issues with other rooms being noisy. Held our luggage on our last day since we had a late night flight, which was very nice so we could do another day of sightseeing :)"

Die Unterkunft bot alles was ich für meinen längeren Aufenthalt benötigte. Das bequeme Bett sorgte für erholsamen Schlaf. Die Wohnung hat einen charmanten, leicht altmodischen Charakter. Die Unterkunft ist sehr hellhörig, daher sollten lärmempfindliche Gäste dies berücksichtigen. Die Lage ist praktisch mit zahlreichen Restaurants, Geschäften, Wäschereien und guter Anbindung an  Verkehrsmittel. Tolle sights. wie der Pier & die berühmte Lombard Street sind schnell erreichbar. In der Nachbarschaft fühlt man sich sehr sicher. <br/>Zusammenfassend war mein Aufenthalt bei Sultan und Julia äußerst angenehm. Ihre Gastfreundschaft, die komfortable Unterkunft und die günstige Lage machten diesen Airbnb-Aufenthalt großartig. Ich empfehle die Unterkunft wärmstens und würde gerne wiederkommen, wenn ich in der Gegend bin."

His love for the neighborhood was deeply felt. The night view from the room was terrific. I myself had to visit various places across the bay area and it turned out to be his place is really well communicated. I was expecting more lyfts but i could use buses and metros (and caltrain) for most of my time. But be sure to look up a bit of details of the mission district though. In San Francisco where hotel stays are either two or five starred, airbnb is definitely a good choice"

Their apartment was spotless, their guidebook was super helpful (including emergency contacts), and check in was a breeze. Super warm & friendly folks, tho we had a booked schedule so did not get to interact with them much. The cul-de-sac felt super private despite being in a prime location. Extremely walkable.

The dwelling was immaculate and Paula was always very responsive and hospitable. The check in was straightforward and instructions were clear. Ample parking was a plus and the location was only 2 blocks from the muni if you wanted to go downtown.<br/>Would definitely recommend staying at this spot if you want to be near Ocean Beach and/or if you want a peaceful location to rest at after your urban explorations."

He checked in to make sure we were travelling safely in the rain and made the driveway parking spot available when we arrived.

Please note that this is more of homestay/real B&B.  You will interact with Darcy (and Nick and Yogi), as they live there, too. She makes an amazing breakfast for you each day. And she bakes some of best sourdough bread you can find in SF!  The rooftop patio with hot tub is such a great refuge, too.  If you're looking for 100% privacy, no interaction with the host or a place to party, this is NOT for you. But if you are looking for a beautiful, quiet, well-located B&B with an attentive, sweet and welcoming host family, we can't say enough good things about this place! :-)"

And the room and bed were very comfy, sheets so soft. Heated toilet seat was a bonus. When we arrived, we shared a bottle of wine with them and chatted on their patio overlooking a magnificent view of the city. Truly breathtaking. We walked to the mission a couple of times and hiked up to Twin Peaks as well. Such a great location. One thing to note: you need to climb a significant brick stairwell to get up to their front door. If you’re carrying a super heavy suitcase, you may want a second hand going up and down. We had 2 smaller suitcases and wore sneakers, so we were fine with it. Would love to come stay again!

One of my Top 5 Airbnbs of all time. Both the indoor and outdoor space are immaculately designed and detailed, with great thought and care put into every corner. The shower, bed, and hot tub were incredible. Location was a 20-30 minute walk to the most exciting parts of the Mission, which was just right for us.

It was the perfect base for us to explore San Francisco, and I would recommend it to anyone coming to the area.  The trams /metros K and M are both very practical for getting into the city, or, of course, an Uber. Target, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods were about a 20-minute walk away (or an 11-minute walk plus a bus), and there is a very nice laundromat about 8-10 minutes away on foot. <br/>Accessibility note: the house is on a hill, but only a quarter of the way up (so not too hard to walk to for most people) and the area itself is generally hilly (like most of SF). Also, the stairs up to the property are a bit steep. There is a half-wall next to the stairs, but it’s too low to use as a bannister. This was no problem for us, but those who need more walking aids might have issues with getting up and down."

The only qualm was the immense amount of noise coming from upstairs. It sounded like constant stomping and running. When I kindly asked them to try to be a bit quieter I was met with a response an hour later stating that it was a busy time in their household. I know the listing mentioned the old house and noises but only at the very end of the ad, wording it to sound as if noise wasn’t as much of a factor as it actually was. The children would be running around the house beginning at 6:45-7am…. Not the most amazing for a vacation, so just be wary that the this might not be as quiet and relaxing as portrayed."

Duboce Park (the actual park) was a bit further than we expected, but there are other green spaces nearby. The office space upstairs was perfect for a business trip / WFH, but families with young children will need to be conscious of the steep stairs. Communication was excellent and check in was easy. Overall, I highly recommend this home!"

The place felt very private. <br/>There were lots of good restaurants and coffee within walking distance. It is just a couple of blocks to Golden Gate Park which our kids enjoyed as well.  <br/>The only downside was parking (the on street parking required the car be moved after 2 hours M-F). This did not affect us much because we visited over a weekend. More of an FYI for someone who is not familiar with the area. This would be the case with most places in San Francisco. <br/>We would definitely rent this place again.

The washer and dryer was a plus. The attached private bath was a nice feature,  but it did not seem very clean, there were hairs in the shower and the floor and mat, and the filter on the ceiling in the bathroom had mold on it. There was a fluid that dripped on me from the moldy vent and it was a little gross. The shared kitchen has a full size fridge, split and labeled for 3 guest spaces and a place setting each. Note- that there is not a sink in the kitchen, so you will need to use your bathroom sink to rinse dishes, also keep this in mind if you like to cook, you would not be able to clean anything. The coffee was empty until the last 2 days and the maker is super tiny which was kind of a bummer, but there is a Starbucks 3 blocks away so that made up for it.

Das eine Doppelbett liegt hinter der Garage. Morgens (viertel vor 7 Uhr) haben wir das Garagentor gehört. Die Tür zur Garage lag in unserem „Schlafzimmer“ ohne Fenster. Von oben hört man die Schritte. Um zur Toilette zu gelangen, muss man durch das der anderen gehen. Die Spülung hat die anderen geweckt.<br/>Der Strand ist fußläufig 10-15 min entfernt. Unter Strandzugang in der Beschreibung verstehe ich (nach meiner Erfahrung von anderen Unterkünften) entweder, dass der Strand hinterm Haus oder 1-2 Quer-Straßen entfernt liegt. Leider entsprach die Beschreibung nicht dem, was wir vorgefunden haben. Daher kann ich diese Unterkunft nicht empfehlen. <br/>Für 2 Personen ist die Unterkunft ok. Wir hoffen, dass ihr beide diese Bewertung zum Anlass nehmt, die Dinge zu beheben. Das hätte für uns allerdings im Vorfeld bereits von Euch gesehen werden müssen. <br/>Beste Grüße"

From the beginning, Heather was accommodating with my check-in time and personally helped with my bags/let me into the flat. The flat itself was very homey, with an extremely comfortable bed and a well-appointed kitchen. Heather also provided great recommendations for the area, I loved Saru Sushi, you can't beat the location here! Walking distance from Noe Valley and the Mission, there's so much to explore.  An added plus was access to a washer and dryer, I was staying for a few weeks so it was helpful to be able to wash my own clothes as well as the linens and towels. Heather was an extremely kind host and I recommend her place to anyone looking to spend time in San Francisco!"

The space is private, comfortable, and homey, with all the essentials provided. As others have mentioned, there's no formal kitchen (no oven and the only sink is in the bathroom), but I was able to cook for myself with no trouble (there's a mini fridge, microwave, two burner hot plate, kettle, rice cooker, etc). Patrick was a wonderful host, who gave me plenty of privacy but was always friendly, responsive, and helpful whenever I reached out.

Excellent price at a fraction of other hotels in SF who jacked up their prices during the RSA Conference.  Good location.  No A/C but luckily don't need it in SF in April.  Primary downside from my perspective was it is a bit loud outside the window with street traffic, so I needed some white noise ... I had a mini speaker and played the rain app ... to try to drown out the noise so I could sleep.   Overall it served its purpose at a very good price."

If you have a family of similar size, just know that it will be very crowded, it’s basically one big room. Also, if you are tall (6 ft) you’ll have to slouch over to avoid hitting your head. <br/>There were a few things that were particularly disappointing: coffee pot contained mold- so it was unusable, no bath towels, and no silverware. So you may want to plan accordingly. The outside traffic wasn’t a problem but you can hear constant footsteps from 8-10 pm which makes it difficult to fall asleep. We wound up buying a box fan to help with that. <br/>On the positive side, Valeria was very responsive when issues popped up and the location was great. We never felt unsafe and all neighbors we interacted with were friendly. <br/>Overall, it worked for what we needed it for but there were a few things lacking that you come to expect from other Air BnB stays."

Adequate shared space in fridge. Common areas are cleaned often. Owners are very responsive. Often getting back to me within an hour.<br/>Cons:<br/>Rarely any parking available on their street. Most days I would have to park 2 to 4 streets away. Always check the street cleaning sign as well. It is the city so it can be loud at night.

Ligeledes ligger det lige over garagen, så det lyser som om der er vejarbejde når porten går op. Du kan høre fulde samtaler både på naboværelset og hos overboen. Der er piv koldt på værelset og der er kun plastik klapstole at sidde på. Sovesofaen er total død, der er en pind i midten af madrassen som stikker op så det ikke er behageligt at ligge der. En dag kom en mus rendende over gulvet i værelset. Badeværelset deles af utroligt mange mennesker - (antallet afhænger af antal bookinger, ved fuldt booket kan det være 12 mennesker) så mange at jeg en aften måtte stå og tisse på gulvet i værelset da toilettet forblev optaget. <br/>Det skal siges at værten er super sød og reagere lyn hurtigt på henvendelser. Vi fik en el radiator ind på værelset hvilket hjalp på varme udfordringen. Området var rigtig fint med offentlig transport tæt på og mulighed for at gå til fx Golden gate."

Despite her absence during our visit, attributed to familial obligations,  Shagun was easy to reach via messaging and always made sure that our stay was going well. We found her instructions to get into the unit easy to follow. <br/>Shagun's home, impeccably organized and well-maintained, exuded an atmosphere of tranquility and serenity, inspiring guests to preserve it and follow along.  I believe Shagun's attitude sets the pace for other guests to be just as considerate; communal areas such as the kitchen and restrooms were kept clean and orderly by fellow guests, reflecting a shared understanding of the importance of maintaining the space.<br/>We met a guest that had stayed there last year and had met Shagun,  and of course she was happy to be back; it seems that the host and her home make a frequent impression on her guests and they return to visit when they are back in town, and we def have intentions of doing the same."

We did have an awkward experience on our first night when someone accidentally entered our room (it was by mistake and they immediately realized it and closed the door) - hopefully steps can be taken to avoid this in the future. Charles was very responsive, and got back to very quickly after an issue with the codes caused us to be locked out. Overall, a recommended place if you need to stay in the area!"

The pictures on the listing definitely made the room look a little bigger than it was in real life. Our first room had a pretty gross stain on the pullout sofa mattress, but once we complained the staff immediately moved us to a new room and they were nice and civil about the situation. Overall our experience at the hotel was good, but please note that if you have a car then trying to find parking in this area is pretty difficult. The hotel was able to give us a spot in a third party parking garage and it was $25 per night (cheapest rate we found in the area). <br/>The location is nice and central to many places in SF, but the homeless population in this particular neighborhood is pretty high so it’s a bit of a rough block to be in, especially at night due to all the noise and commotion."

The whole place was so thoughtfully done, beautiful finishing touches that photos don’t even do justice. I was able to meditate on the clean private patio with the sounds of the leaves and birds (and the occasional city siren). Oh, and their tea selection was more extensive than even a few high-end hotels I had stayed at! Thank you again for the lovely stay, guys—you’ve definitely exceeded our expectations!<br/>- Andrew"

Lots of fun shops and places to eat nearby; super walkable. The space is very nice and clean. I hadn't read a previous review noting the lack of a common sitting area so was a little surprised by this but it was fine. If you're at that point in your travels when you just want to relax indoors, or the weather isn't great so you'll be spending several hours inside besides sleeping, I can imagine wanting a sitting area, a more conveniently located tv and a larger table. The  bath was a treat. We had no trouble finding a street parking spot. Host communicated well. Overall, we recommend Susan's place!"

Franc is a great host and the room is pretty much exactly as described. I found my stay peaceful and quiet. Everything is fairly self-service—it's easy to get inside and easy to navigate the space. <br/>I recommend Q's sandwich shop a couple blocks away. There's also a bike dock on the same block, and no fewer than 3 different public parks within walking/running distance. It's a great area. I didn't really take public transit, but I brought my Subaru Crosstrek, and I did like being able to drive around. The parking felt safe/secure at Franc's.<br/>I was given extra towels because of the long stay, and had access to the washer & dryer. The washer & dryer are shared, so they were often in use. Overall, I loved my time here and feel lucky to have stayed at such a well-kept and thoughtfully furnished AirBnb. There is obvious attention to detail and I didn't want for anything while there."

I was coming from Portland to SF but my flight got pushed back. All our communications was done via the airbnb app. Hai Lin and team allowed me to change my stay dates without penalties as long as it was before the initial checkin date. When I finally got to SF, the airbnb was easy to find and I received clear instructions from Hai Lin and his team from the Airbnb app. There were helpful signs to guide me to the room from the entrance, which continued inside the room e.g. this door is for storage, or not to use the heater and the hair dryer at the same time to prevent circuit trips. The bed was super comfortable and I slept really well during my stay. I drove my car and there was ample street parking. I ended up wanting to extend my stay for 1 more day and was quickly approved by Hai Lin and team within an hour."

I’m sure there continues to be real problems in the City overall, but we felt safe in this area and opted out of the parking garage for street parking on our second night. If you are looking for some amazing food try Dumpling Home (you’ll need a car or public transport to get there, but wow!!!).

Keith was a fantastic host - friendly and social, but also respectful of my privacy. The keyless entry added an extra layer of security, and the room was stocked with small details like charging stations for any phone type, an in-room speaker, and plenty of closet space. The bath salts, lotions, Kheil's beauty products, mouthwash, feminine products for women, and a cart full of SPF and hygiene essentials were a thoughtful touch. I highly recommend Keith's Airbnb for anyone looking for a comfortable and welcoming place to stay in San Francisco!

Rooms are set up with capsules that have thick curtains you can pull down to give yourself complete privacy. They have lights, a fan, and USB ports insed. Everything was very clean, front desk staff were very helpful. It's just outside some of the sketchier parts of San Francisco but the area is pretty good itself (it is SF though). Only potential downside is the shower to bed ratio is a little low and you need to battle to get into the shower (one shower was being renovated while I was there though). It is a hostel though so that's not too unusual. Bathrooms were all exceptionally clean though as was everything else. Staff was on point for that. The building itself is really cool as you're in a music museum. They do have a room where bands can reherse but you don't hear that at all in the sleeping areas. Highly recommend overall. Was not expecting this level of quality for the price."

Hosts were also very responsive. Just good to know that being directly on the very busy and trafficked 19th Ave makes stopping in front of the house a bit scary. Don't open doors on the street side of your car when traffic is coming, and be very careful stepping out of the car). Tuesday nights there's no parking on 19th street due to street cleaning early Wednesday mornings, so you have to find parking on nearby side streets. If it's already evening finding a spot can be very hard, and you might end up being a few blocks away from the house.  I think it's good for others to know this parking situation in advance of making the booking. However, the hosts told me if they knew in advance they could provide their own parking space on the street. No outside place to hangout here."

However, we quickly began having issues. First, an ant infestation that Kinsley let us know was to be expected when it rains. She was responsive in helping us to mitigate it, but wasn't particularly concerned either. Over the next few days we continued to get bug bites until we finally found and captured fleas. When we reached out, Kinsley was defensive about why there were fleas and didn't ask if we were ok, which is the minimum we'd expect. She let us know that she'd have pest control come in a few days and that in the meantime she could come vacuum, but offered no apology and no other support to help us deal with the infestation in the apartment, our bed, and our luggage.<br/>We ended up spending a whole weekend trying to find another place to stay, packing up our things and finding laundry facilities to disinfect them from the fleas. Wish the host cared about guests' well-being more."

I got a message from Mark early on the day I left home and was in communication with him for the whole trip.  When I finally got to the flat, Mark even offered to carry my suit case up the one thousand steps to the room.  The whole time I was in San Francisco, I felt at home.  Mark made breakfast for me and we even sat and chatted on his rooftop.  When I needed to get somewhere, Mark was active in making sure I got there.  When I wanted to eat something, he not only gave me directions, but he gave me pretty amazing recommendations.  Mark definitely understands the folks who are staying with him.  The night before the race, Mark walked me to a local pizza place and even made fun of me when I was taking too long looking at the menu and trying to make a decision.  On race day, Mark tracked my progress in the race and was really invested in my success.  This was really a great find."

We communicated ahead of time on arrival logistics, and she was very accommodating to my non-ideal flight schedule. I'm so glad we were able to meet in person briefly when we happened to get ""home"" at the same time one evening!<br/>The space is quite large - I never really even checked out the upper levels of the loft! The kitchenette was well stocked with necessities, appliances, and utensils and the bathroom was also well appointed. One note for potential guests -- you may wish to bring your own soap and shampoo if you're not into lavender :)<br/>I would not hesitate to stay at Vidhu's place on future trips to SF!"

A lot of work went in to making the place look and feel like home.

The building is near the city hall, opera house/symphony and Hayes Valley (my favorite part of SF). Super convenient and walkable pretty much to anywhere. Great restaurants, market, gyms, post office, ups.. everything is near. Public transportation is not far either. <br/>The place is just as the pictures and as described. Very clean and quiet especially for the San Francisco standard. There’s a school next block and you’d be surprised when you open the window during the day to see how good the soundproofing is. There is everything you’d need to live in the unit. And Al is the best host. Really. Very nice, helpful, friendly and very responsive. Hope I can stay here again for the next visit."

The furniture, the details in the design, the comfort level of the beds, sheets, towels, I must say that everything is very well done.<br/>I particularly enjoyed the kitchen because it is very well-equipped with most everything you will need (not including ingredients). It's rare to have a bnb with the right cooking tools. There is also an organic grocery store steps away.<br/>The only issue was that the construction is happening right behind the house and they were starting pretty early, as in before 8am or perhaps 7am. One night there was an alarm sound coming from the construction site all night that kept us up, but the let the host know and they were super responsive and on top of it. Aileen's team was very helpful and I can't say enough great things about them.<br/>It's good to note that if you plan on driving, there is street cleaning on of one of the weekday mornings so be sure to check the signs.<br/>Overall, I recommend this apartment for many reasons."

Space was very clean and comfortable, and balcony access was very pleasant.<br/>Only drawback for us was it was kind of busy and noisy in the house the whole time we were there. Obviously it's the hosts' space first, but it made relaxing mid-day difficult. Maybe just the nature of single room Airbnbs in SF."

We enjoyed such a great relaxing time, and Ken was always accessible by text if we had a question.

The house is truly a remarkable piece of history that we felt privileged to spend time in. It has many original touches and has been curated with special art that was a joy to be around. However, the beds, showers, linens, kitchen, technology were all extremely up to date, comfortable and convenient. If you are curious about the apartment upstairs that shares the front entrance: the tenants use the same front door and go up to the second floor, and then up to their apartment on the 3rd floor. We were there for 5 days and only saw 2 people twice and they were extremely kind and introduced themselves. It is clearly a kind and professional set up that allows the house to benefit all.

And to wake up every morning with such an amazing view from that sunroom--well, that was just what the doctor ordered. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here in this safe, cozy, comfortable, quiet little nook in the hills above Castro. Kurt and Pedro were wonderful hosts--very welcoming, kind, and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed and were quick to respond with any questions or concerns. It was really nice to be able to just walk across the street to Corona Heights Park--which, in my opinion, is the best vantage point from which to soak in the unique geography of this city, with the downtown in one direction, and Twin Peaks in the other. It was an easy walk to Castro and Haight-Ashbury (though not such as easy walk back!). And it was an easy ride to anywhere else in the city.

Was exactly as described and then some. We’ve been to San Francisco many times and this was the first time staying in this neighborhood and we loved it. You can really see the sense of community, we really enjoyed seeing the tai chi classes and soccer games while taking a walk in the beautiful wooded park across the street. Finding parking was super easy and free,  just read the signs for street sweepers and be mindful of blocking driveways. Great visit, would definitely book again!!"

Cesar met us with a smile and a helping hand with our luggage even! the view from the top of this lovely home is exquisite. The owner is clearly a well traveled collector, one could spend hours perusing the unique collection of art, objects and books. And the bed! it was like sleeping on a cloud amongst the stars. It's a short, simple stroll to all that The Castro has to offer. Even though we didn't have the entire home to ourselves, it seemed like we did as we heard not another soul other than a fellow guest slip-out in the morning as we were getting ready to go out for coffee. Thank you Queen Of The Castro for a delightful respite."

The host left a few chocolates and a friendly note welcoming us to the hotel which added a nice touch, the employees at the front desk are very friendly and helpful and willing to give recommendations on what to do around the city.

Being in a more residential area of the city, the unit is very quiet and peaceful. There are also local restaurants and shops just around the corner too.

He was very helpful with showing us where to park and even allowing us to use his garage, as there are some parking restrictions in place on the road. He also very kindly offered to do our laundry as we are on a long trip and asked for a nearby laundromat, and also allowed us to get an amazon parcel delivered too. The space itself is really lovely - has everything we needed and is clean and stylish. It's pretty easy access through the back garden, and is also only minutes away from the nearest public transport into the city. We also loved Sven's recommendations for things to do and places to eat - especially La Taqueria CanCun which was a local Mexican and the best we've ever tried!!

Gates opened at 11am Friday and we were able to (1) park on the street right across the Airbnb and (2) drop our bags off in the room before the festival.  We are so grateful that didn’t have to stress about parking or our belongings. The main entrance to the festival on 30th was only a 15 minute walk from the Airbnb. Just a few things to note (1) you will have to walk up two/three sets of stairs and (2) the bathrooms aren’t attached to the rooms. We stayed in room 2 and our toilet room was directly across the hallway. Room 1 was assigned the bathroom with the shower. Since you are sharing a shower with another guest you may want to bring shower slippers or flip flops to walk around in. We made friends with the other guests and were not stressed about sharing a space but if you are concerned, each room has its own lock! This is a great place to stay if you want a safe place to rest after a full day of enjoying the city."

The flat itself was great: enough space for all of us, nice furniture, very comfortable beds (especially the sofa bed), clean bathroom and well equiped kitchen (which we haven't used though). However, for us the apartment was too cold, the heater to loud/too little reliable, we could hear the neighbours very well, and we missed the daylight in the room.

What I experienced was a shower under disrepair, i.e., the handle was broken off and a trench in the floor about 3 feet long by 2.5 inches deep with a piece of jagged wire extending from a plug/filter.  The noise level from upstairs (feet pounding back and forth) went on till after 11 pm at night, making it impossible to sleep.  I noticed later that there was a no refund policy in place and was still forced after 2 days on an intended 20-day stay to check out early.  I finally got a refund after stating, ""If you don't give me some kind of refund, you are forcing me to stay.  I honestly believe they thought they were entitled to my money even though they had made it impossible for me to stay there.  beyond that, the unit was freezing even with the miniature space heater provided, and the freezer was completely frozen over with leftover food items left in the fridge.

We asked for a few items for our toddler and they promptly arranged it. So, very glad with the hosts and the apartment. However, I have to say the location was not at all good especially for family. We did not know much about places in downtown SF and this particular place had a lot of homeless people and streets were very dirty. Walking with family (we had a toddler) to nearby places was hard. So, if you are ok with those external favors, then it’s a very good apartment and the hosts were very nice."

We heard the cats softly running around a little, which was cute and not at all a negative. Otherwise we heard nothing.

The apartment is incredibly spacious, with plenty of rooms to accommodate a large group comfortably. The living room is particularly impressive, providing a generous and inviting space for relaxation and spending time together. Additionally, the kitchen is well-equipped, making it easy for us to prepare meals and enjoy home-cooked food during our stay.<br/>The location of the apartment is fantastic, with easy access to Chinatown just a few blocks away. It was great to explore the neighborhood and take in all the sights and sounds of the area.<br/>Although there is one consideration to keep in mind, as two of the bedrooms are located in the basement and do not have any windows, this did not detract from our enjoyment of the apartment. In fact, we found that it added to the unique character of the space.<br/>Overall, we had an exceptional stay and highly recommended this Airbnb."

It was about a 5 minute walk  and it was great especially because we avoided all the traffic after the concert. At night it is a bit sketchy coming back just because all of the homeless but there was so many people out that night it was fine. There is no parking available so we parked at a lot around the corner and payed $25 each night we stayed there. It seemed sketchy but the guy was really nice. Upon arrival there is a lot of homeless hanging out all around the area  and we were a bit nervous at first but you eventually you get used to them. The room looked exactly like the pictures. It was nice, it had a mini fridge, a fan/ heater and everything that it lists. We booked the shared bathroom and it was great too. Staff were friendly and the room was clean.

This isn’t necessarily Thomas’ fault so much as a microcosm for Airbnbs failure as a business. Nothing is necessarily wrong with the location or room but for the price you’re better off paying for a hotel where you don’t have to awkwardly share a bathroom or kitchen space or even worry about cleaning up. I didn’t stay here after seeing my room space and booked a hotel instead. For a little more I got peace of mind and a bed that didn’t smell. Sorry Thomas."

Bus stop for bus #8 that takes you into the center of San Francisco a 2 minute walk from Hui’s place.  Bus goes every 10 minutes.  Bus ride into SF 30-40 minutes (depending on bus and traffic).  Hui is kind, friendly, and helpful."

City life is just that if you’re not use to living in a western city the urban problems might be too in your face.  Dan is a great host and responded to every need we had.  After getting used to the noise level and being in the city we had a wonderful stay every day walking the embarcadaro.  Building felt safe and the place is very clean.  At the end of the day we still rate a 5 star."

We needed a place close by our own home that was being renovated for 2.5 months. We had some issues - Lauren was very responsive and we solved it all. <br/>The neighborhood is great. The place is very nice and spacious, comes with all things you need, not just the pure basics - Nespresso pods and much more. It does have 3 functional bedrooms, with plenty working space and every room has a TV, but with the note that the loft area has no windows to the outside (only windows to the inside) and the bonus room downstairs is setup as bedroom, but has no windows at all. One of three bedroom has actual windows to the outside. The split level is a plus, make the place feel even more spacious. The parking needs explanation. No private parking available. Street parking is 2 or 4 hours from 8 am until 10 pm Mo-Sat. So if you don't have a permit like we (EE), within reason undoable to have your own car."

We chose it because we had a senior dog with us for half the stay - ground floor garden access and easy walk to Golden Gate Park were perfect for her. If you’re visiting, you will love being minutes from everything going on at the park, museums etc. and some great food options.<br/>Unfortunately as this is the ‘foggy side’ of the city so it’s colder and damper, and that extended to the apartment - very musty smell, and things refuse to dry. Everything was constantly getting wet too, because a few things leak (coffee pot) or don’t drain (shower/bathroom are all one room and drain is not at the low point) - I even found mold on a pair of unworn sandals in the bedroom closet.<br/>The host is so kind and offered me use of the dryer upstairs. That highlighted another cleanliness issue - while up there I spotted a mouse, and after we no longer had the dog with us, we saw one in our unit too. Cannot rate well for cleanliness. Host and location both 5 stars"

The home is in a safe neighborhood with plenty of free parking and the accommodations are clean and comfortable. The bed is especially very luxiourious and comfy! The kitchen and bathroom are on the dated side, but, like the entire studio, they were clean and well stocked. I especially loved the view of the beautiful tree out the kitchen window. Some may be concerned initially upon arriving as the exterior of the house is in need of major cosmetic repair (peeling paint and very weathered balcony). Don't be. Once inside the studio, all is quite clean and comfortable! The hosts were away during my week and a half stay, but they were always responsive and communicated well.

There is only 1 tv in the living room that has roku so you are able to log in and access your apps to watch tv. We weren't there much to watch tv but they aren't that far from the beach and the zoo.  We caught ubers/lyfts very easy and getting back to the house was easy.  They are about a 20-30 min ride to downtown san fran depending on traffic.  If I had any questions I got a quick response.

From cutlery to a bag on its own little hook in the bathroom labeled “inconspicuous bag of feminine hygiene products” (lol) and creamer in the mini fridge, they’ve thought of everything you might need. They also checked in on us to see if we needed anything and we’re very friendly the few times we ran into them passing through the shared garage space (where they kindly allowed us to stow our luggage since our flight arrived well before check in). The location is also phenomenal. You have Dolores Park across the street, Muni and Bart stops nearby, and a million great spots to eat, drink, and shop on Valencia. There’s nothing missing!

The location cannot be beat for a home base to explore the city (you do not need a car as there is every form of public transportation available within a few blocks including BART to both SFO and OAK). I have gotten to know Doris personally over the years and she is a very sweet and always welcoming host. Hope to be back soon!"

Train line runs outside the front door, so if you can handle the noise, there’s excellent access to amenities. We enjoyed being close to the beach and the state park. Beds were comfortable. On the flip side, the kitchen was not well stocked so be prepared for one pot meals and frequently hand washing your dishes (1 wine glass and only 4 drinking cups supplied). Unfortunately cleanliness was also a major issue-not sure if we just had bad luck after the previous occupants, but under the posh decorations the main living areas were filthy- wet and stained couch cushions, cabinets and counters sticky with grime, dirty dishes. I’m not typically all that squeamish with homestay, but this one tested me."

It was described as the 1st floor of a 2-story building, and while that may be technically true, this first floor is inside a garage. The entrance to the unit opens up into their garage with their car right there. The garage did not have a light inside that we were able to find and the unit was much darker inside than the photos made it look. It also had an auto smell to it, which was not all that surprising given its location. We did not end up staying the night as we were not comfortable with the place. With the taxes and fees tacked on, this place was too expensive for what it is, in our opinion. We were able to book at a downtown hotel that same night for less than half the price of what we were charged at this Airbnb."

Traveling with our 1 year old is tough, but Eva’s place had plenty of room for us and all of our stuff! The bedroom was very dark, which was perfect for her midday naps. Very quiet neighborhood, which we appreciated. Also, maybe the best feature- east parking! Usually a nightmare in SF, but never a problem here. Would definitely stay here again!"

It’s beautiful, with a great garden. The bed was really comfy, and the pullout sofa worked well for our young son. Everything is labeled, which is so helpful, and there are lots of extras, from snacks to spare toys to supplies. There isn’t a full kitchen, just a well-appointed closet with a coffee maker, mini fridge, and microwave, which we were expecting and was more than enough to meet our needs. One note—this is a “basement” unit and you can hear some noise overhead. It didn’t bother us and wasn’t happening late at night, but if you are very sensitive to noise this may not be the place for you. We loved it, and hope to return soon!"

Across the street on market street it’s pretty filled with homeless people but while being inside the hotel you tend to forget about the craziness across the street.

Not much street parking but use the parking lots blocks away or just Uber. Short stay I’ll recommend."

The rental is within walking distance of public transportation to take you to all SF sights and experiences.  Tri's place is also within walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores.  I cannot say enough about Tri.  He greeted us when we arrived and checked in with us daily to make sure we had everything we needed.  Tri gave us great suggestions for places to dine and sights to see.  When he learned we did not have a car, he offered his time to take us around.  We enjoyed spending time with Tri   as he drove us around sightseeing and allowing us photo opportunities. Tri's goal was not only to provide a home away from home, but also to make sure we had a good time visiting SF.  I have already recommended Tri's rental to friends and family.  Without hesitation, my family and I would stay at Tri's rental in the future."

Make sure if you do park, you take anything that’s visible out<br/>Overall my wife and I had a pleasant stay. Unfortunately our experience was made a bit sour during checkout. While admittedly we were two minutes late leaving, a man entered from the back of the unit(there are two entrances) and rudely reminded us twice that checkout was at 11.

The bed was comfortable and the view to the back yard helps it feel private. Street parking is 2hr only M-F so I was grateful for the parking space. Note for light sleepers - You can definitely hear a small doggo walking upstairs in case that is a deal breaker but mostly I found it endearing."

Everything you need is down the block or a street away. The apartment is situated in a quiet, safe residential area of the Mission. The apartment is well designed with modern appliances including dishwasher, stove, range, washing machine and dryer and there are two bedrooms.  The layout, energy, airiness, and high ceilings made this a pleasurable experience as though we were living in our own home. It was convenient to have a garage space for our car and carriage. It is fantastic for a family since our daughters loved staying here and playing.  The pictures of the apartment are truly accurate, and our family adored the place and enjoyed coming over. We would definitely come back and stay in this home for another week when we return to San Francisco."

The best part is that it had a stove top so we could cook our own breakfast, and the location as it was super well connected to public transport. It is located on a busy street but the apartment is towards the back of the house, so has no street noise. Irving street is around the corner and has brilliant Asian food options. <br/>Unfortunately, the walls (and ceiling) are very thin. You could hear a lot of walking / running noises from above; an adjacent unit was  rented to very noisy people and you could hear every word. Depends of course a bit on the tenants but just something to keep in mind if someone is a light sleeper."

Communication with Vin was always easy.   It was our first time in San Francisco and the space and location could not have been better for our family of four (two adults and two teenagers).  Having the airbed option (it's a really nice big bed) was perfect for the kids to each have their own space.   Tasteful and unique decor with a great layout.  Vin's place is on a relatively quiet street but easy and safe walking to many restaurants and stores.   Nob hill has beautiful architecture  and felt safe and fun to walk around.  I would highly recommend this apartment.  We loved it and we loved San Francisco."

It was great to have a fully equipped kitchen after a long day of exploring the city. Commuting by bus is easy with the Muni app and you can reach all parts of the city.

Super clean and comfortable but definitely only appropriate for 1 person or a couple who doesn’t need a lot of space from each other.  My wife and I were 100% satisfied with the place and it was all that we needed for our one night stay in San Francisco.<br/>All of Paula’s recommendations were delicious!  And she was super responsive AND proactive.<br/>My only advice is DO NOT LEAVE ANY BELONGINGS in your car in San Fran.   Literally nothing… ever… be sure to drop off all of your belongings at the Airbnb before you go out for the day.  This is not a joke, but also not a reflection of Paula or the area in which her Airbnb is located.  This is a PSA about San Fran.  Smash and Grabs are real!<br/>But Paula and her place are wonderful and we highly recommend."

They did not hesitate and responded with helpful instructions, allowing us to check in early and even helped us store our bags before we were able to go to our room. Valet parking was super helpful as well! I loved the front desk staff, they were super polite and professional but also friendly. The interior of the hotel lobby was phenomenal. We got to our room and it was nice, clean and cozy! A huge bed with a huge sofa bed. At first I didn’t think it(sofa bed) would be comfortable since it was a thin spring bed but it worked out just fine, no back pain ! The pillows are super soft and fluffy. I loved everything about our stay! The employees were the best part about our stay, very accommodating, helpful and informative, polite and professional."

As two friends from Australia we really wanted something clean, modern, cozy, safe, and easy to find on our first 3 nights in the US. Kelly's placed delivered this and went above our expectations. It is a wonderful place, in a very safe locaction, and the proximity of the Muni tram into the city was fantastic and easy to use. The free street parking was also a bonus as we hired a car on our second day. I'd also like to mention our appreciation of the amenities in the room, such as the Nespresso machine, the milk, and the wine. The bathroom also had a hair dryer and wonderful soaps which smelt so good. 120% recommend this place to anyone looking for a reliable place to stay in San Francisco."

The location is great - close to the beach and great restaurants. Eileen was an excellent host and went above and beyond to help us out and make sure we had a great stay.

It was within blocks of both necessary public transit, a large selection of restaurants and stores, and even tourist attractions like the Painted Ladies. You would think a place like this would be hard to sleep in, but it was surprisingly so peaceful and quiet! Even so, the host provided earplugs for those who are exceptionally light sleepers. The directions provided made accessing the room very clear. Everything is nicely labeled. Larry was also gracious enough to allow us to drop our bags off in a small common area before the room was ready since our flight landed so much earlier than check-in time. We used the common kitchen every day with no problem. Everything was clean and there were plenty of communal dishes and utensils. The room itself was exactly as advertised. It is in a beautiful old building with hardwood floors, exactly as advertised. I was concerned about the cold, but the place is so well insulated! 10/10"

This location was safe quiet and very peaceful. The place itself was generally clean and the house was well organized. The only problems that I had with my stay, is that Bryn was there pretty much the entire time and added a few additional rules we werent initially aware of prior to moving in. The most bizzare being that we were not allowed to step foot in his Living Room with his multiple large couches and television set. This was a large part of the house that he directly told me he did not want to share with guests. I would have felt that this was a more normal request if he just meant to not use it while hes using it, but he meant not using it at all regardless of if he was there or not.

The room was clean, cozy and with a decent kitchen set up with all the utensils you might need (and a full size fridge). The bathroom had thoughtful toiletries. The motel is surprisingly quiet but close to a main road for east access. <br/>The only thing was that the parking spots were tight but this was very well communicated on the listing so I was aware of it, as well as the first come first serve so it wasn’t a surprise.

The three bedrooms and 1.5 bath gave this family of four with two adult children, an abundance of room to relax and stretch.

If you are lucky you will find the spot in front of the house otherwise be ready to walk a block or two to find parking. <br/>Also may be due to cultural differences the host had a different communication style. <br/>When asked to check kitchen sink, the host comes pounding at the door 730 in the morning and does not stop until he wakes you up. <br/>Also when i asked for parking spot I was flatly refused and told to look for parking a block <br/> away.

Das Bad ist sauber und die zwei Schlafzimmer bieten mehrere Betten mit gemütlichen Matratzen (ein Schlafzimmer mit einem Doppelbett und eins mit zwei Doppelbetten).<br/>Zusätzlich dazu ist ein privater Parkplatz in der hauseigenen Garage vorhanden, was in einem PKW-dominierten Land wie den USA Gold wert ist.<br/>Wir kommen sehr sehr gerne wieder und bedanken uns für die schöne Zeit!!!"

This property is lovely, immaculately clean, well-appointed, and it was the perfect space for me and my daughter during a long weekend trip to SF.  The Pacific Heights neighborhood is beautiful and inviting; there are two well maintained parks within easy walking distance. There are plenty of shops and restaurants just a few blocks from the property and lots of fun places to explore.  <br/>Simon was an exceptional host and went out of his way to address all of my questions upon arrival.  He checked in on us throughout the stay to ensure we were comfortable and did not need anything.  He also provided great recommendations for local eateries and his online AirBnB guest book has great tips that helped us as well.  We will definitely return to this beautiful property and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful, central place in the city!  Book it!"

It was lovingly and beautifully decorated, and so many wonderful surprises everywhere we turned. We found everything we needed from the tea, to games, to a hair dryer. We especially appreciated the parking instructions because parking was hard to find in the neighborhood. Ocean Beach is a short walk away and Lands End and all the attractions in Golden Gate Park are a short drive away. We also loved that it was half a block from Beach'n SF, great vegan spot for coffee, breakfast, and sandwiches. Thank you Jessica for such a wonderful stay!"

However I adjusted the blinds to view flower boxes in living space during the day . The amenities were great in kitchen and bathroom. Large closet in bedroom . Kaleen is definitely a super host.

The bedroom is light and airy, the bed is very comfortable. The room being at the  back of the building is very quiet. Scott Street itself isn't busy. We liked that there are a number of coffee shops very near. We tried several and liked Cafe du Soliel best. About a 20 minute walk away is Castro Indian Bar & Restaurant we'd give 5 starts for flavor, reasonable price and great service. <br/>Looking at AirBnBs, trying to  choose, they run together. I thought Franc's place had a common area and a shared kitchen. It doesn't and that was my fault for getting it mixed up with another place. That being said, there is a coffee maker, a nice mini fridge, a microwave, wine glasses, regular glasses, and knives & forks. Not sure why no plates. I had a breakfast burrito that I had warm in a mug. No big deal but a plate would be nice. Overall, a good location, reasonable price."

And the neighborhood was incredibly quiet and peaceful despite being only a short distance from great food and stores in Bernal and the Mission. Highly recommended!"

The apartment is beautiful and thoughtfully decorated. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen had everything I could need, and there was no need to buy basics, such as trash bags, dishwasher detergent, etc. I hope to stay here again!"

I am familiar with the city and knew the area where I would be staying before I got here. The other reviews are all spot on - it's a lovely place, secure, with a comfy bed, good shower pressure, all the basic amenities you would expect from a hotel room plus a few more. Hosts are great and very responsive. It's really close to a Bay Wheels bike rack, there are electric scooters everywhere, you're close to several bus routes, and the Civic Center BART/Muni station is walking distance away. SoMa is gritty and it's true that there are a lot of unhoused folks who stay in the area, mostly because there are a lot of social support services nearby. So you do have to watch where you're stepping since there are people camping out and some drug paraphernalia. But at no point did I feel unsafe, even as a woman walking through some of the nearby streets at night. No one bothered me at all. Just walk with purpose and you'll be fine. Would stay again."

As we were staying nearly three weeks we very really happy to have found such a comfortable and quiet place right in the middle of town. The beautiful garden was a wonderful bonus. There are even humming birds (which is quite unusual for Germans!) The Castro district, in which the apartment is located, is a really relaxed and colorful neighbourhood and public transport (busses, MUNI subway or BART) can easily be reached. Robert and Bernie were extremely kind and helpful (they organized a cable for my laptop and gave us good advice where to go in and around SF). As we stayed there during Halloween  we were also surprised with a little 'scare' and some sweets in front of our door! And we must also mention the comfortable bed, which was perfect to rest after an exciting day. We absolutely recommend this apartment. It's perfectly clean, the interior is very tasteful and the kitchen is well equipped! So, all thumbs up!"

They are a wonderful Ukrainian couple , and from the minute I arrived I felt truly welcomed. The studio is immaculate and fully stocked. I stayed for six months and never once did I need anything. Still, Tatyana and Felix make sure to check if anything is needed; they are an extremely attentive couple.<br/>The area itself is ideal if you’re looking for peace and quiet. It really feels like you’re not in San Francisco. It’s a gated community and you’d be surrounded by trees, Lake Merced, and rolling golf courses. I would spend most afternoons after work at the lake, just taking in the views.<br/>Parking is free and plentiful, although you need to obtain a parking permit at the gate. If your stay is long term ask them to give you a permit for the whole duration of your stay. <br/>I’m going to miss Tanya and Felix. I would’ve stayed much longer if not for a change in jobs.

Clear instructions were provided and checking in was a breeze with the door keypads. Michael responded quickly to all questions and requests and even catered for us to stay for an extra day as some of our group had late flights on the check out day. Small details were very well thought out and provided e.g. fresh fruit and supplies in the fridge, ear plugs and blindfolds in the cabinets next to the bed, charging ports and cables for different phone types throughout the house.<br/>The location was great and was walking distance to many bars, cafes and restaurants where we were guided by Michael's recommendations. Thanks for your hospitality Michael it really made our time spent here all the better!"

It was a lovely apartment, very clean and beautiful.  Getting into the apartment was very easy except for the flight of steps getting into the apartment.  We had heavy luggages as we are preparing to move into our apartment.<br/>Kim communicate very fast. <br/>The location was good for me because it served the purpose that I needed.  I found that there is a Target and Trader Joe’s nearby.<br/>The only problem that I had was the $120 cleaning fees, which is quite expensive.  As I was staying for only 1 night, it would have been cheaper for me to book into a hotel.<br/>Overall, I really enjoyed Kim’s place and highly recommend Kim's place."

SF is super expensive, so relative to other places this was a good deal.  The WiFi was generally good but I found a bit slow at peak times occasionally."

The parking situation isn’t ideal (you’re given the option to pay $35/day for parking which may or may not be available, as spaces are very limited) and the amenities are pretty basic, but for the price, it isn’t any less than you’d expect. The advertised “dog-friendly” outdoor area was also under construction and unusable, which was disappointing.

The house is an absolute gem, and in a very convenient location. You can walk everywhere and anywhere since you're in the middle of SF. The bed is extremely comfortable. The only reason why I didn't end up over sleeping everyday is cuz there are no blackout curtains or soundproof windows, so sunlight and street noise comes in around the morning. I didn't eat in any of the two days so can't speak to the use of the kitchen, but there was coffee and some cereal bars.

It was clean, comfortable and homey even though I wasn’t there for too long. I appreciate the thoughtful details put into the room—bedside lamps, desk, plenty of outlets, a couch to watch tv (which I think also converts to a bed), extra cups in the bathroom to rinse, water bottles, house slippers, etc. The towels felt luxurious, and I thought the shower pressure was just right. <br/>Since I was there for such a short period of time, I didn’t do much exploring, but I did take a nice walk to Noriega St, and it was easy and a quick walk to catch the 28 bus to Irving St. <br/>Overall, definitely a great stay and a nice place to recharge."

The place is very dusty and the furnitures are kinda dirty. A lot of unnecessary decorations. The master bed was probably the worst. My husband and I are not very picky with bed, but as soon as we lay down, it was super firm and hard as a plywood. I reached out to see if there was any resolution for that because my it was super hard and you can’t sleep in it. We ended up sleeping in the couch for four days because they said they can’t do anything to it because we are the only one who complained about it.

My colleagues and I stayed for a conference and it fit all 3 of us very comfortably. Their entire home was such a warm, thoughtfully crafted space full of wonderful art, books, and natural lighting! Greg and Michèle had a wonderful binder full of local spots and recommendations. It was everything we needed and more!

Walked south to Oracle Park + north to Fisherman’s Wharf and everything in between over several day stay. That said you are near “tenderloin” district and unfortunately homelessness; did have a tent resident directly across the street with lots of others and street noise at night. Other than this and somewhat tight room space (bunk beds + bathroom) it’s not a bad spot and solid value."

The only downfall and I’m very hesitant to even put just because it was such a great experience, is that the walls are super thin and you can hear as much as a phone ring from upstairs. Not really a problem for us but I felt a bit hesitant when it came to watching even just a tv show past 10pm"

We informed our host who answered quickly and shared additional network but didn’t solve our issue. <br/>Be prepare to wait around 10/15min to get hot water in the shower.<br/>Heating system isn’t working properly.<br/>You can hear all the noise from the neighboor upstairs.

There’s plenty of restaurants and shops within a couple of blocks to pick up everything you need. Street parking is pretty easy. Neighborhood felt safe and quiet. I always appreciate being able to let myself in with a keypad so I don’t have the added stress of coordinating an arrival time when exhausted from traveling. The family lives upstairs and were very helpful and kind, yet the space felt private. Lots of games and books to entertain kids. Overall, a great value, convenient, pleasant -would stay again!"

Nel salone, oltre a zeppe di cartone sotto le zampe dell'orologio a pendolo e del tavolo varia sporcizia dietro il divano. In cucina macchie per terra e vicino al bidone della spazzatura, sotto i mobili della cucina tantissima sporcizia, nel disimpegno che porta al bagno tante ragnatele sui vetri delle finestre e buste di cotone macchiate. In camera da letto le tende leggere strappate e sporche. Il principale motivo per cui ho scelto quest'alloggio era nel terrazzino della camera da letto, che abbiamo usato solo una volta dopo aver pulito accuratamente!!! Nel terrazzo regnava la sporcizia, terra sparsa ovunque, un paio di occhiali buttati, sedie e tavolino sporchi, scope per terra, sigarette nei vasi, etichette strappate, e ragnatele ovunque, disgustoso. Inoltre non esiste un armadio o una cassettiera dove poter sistemare i vestiti. Prezzo decisamente altissimo per il servizio offerto. Ho le foto di tutto."

Cynthia greeted us and showed us around the space. Our requests and inquiries were responded to in a friendly and timely manner. The space itself is cute - the bed is comfy, the kitchenette has a coffeemaker, toaster, microwave, dishes and utensils. The shower is fabulous. The location is perfect - steps away from coffee shops, bakeries and panaderias, taquerias, laundromats, the 24th St. Bart station, shops, bars, and restaurants of any sort of cuisine you can imagine. The neighborhood is lively, with two beautiful parks just blocks away. We highly recommend Casa Treat for your stay in the Mission."

The common areas were very dirty, and the smell in the refrigerator was absolutely disgusting, as there was food that was several years old. Another recurring issue was that the hot water in the shower often did not work, and the host had to come arrange it many times. It was very frustrating to arrive home from work late at night and not have hot water for a shower. The host was responsive and would sometimes fix things when asked (the fridge was cleared eventually but still smelled terrible), but he was never apologetic for any of the circumstances that should not have been acceptable."

It's within just a couple blocks of the Moscone center and hard to beat for the price. It's on the smaller side but when you're really only there for sleeping that's not a problem. The only issue we had was the bed in the room was not a queen size like the listing says. I know some of the rooms have a private bath so those might be a bit bigger and have a queen but our room had a full xl at the biggest. There was enough room but smaller than we thought we were getting. Besides that, Noel was super responsive and everything else was pretty well-kept.

However, its closeness to the high-crime Tenderloin district made me uneasy post-sunset, often resorting to cabs. Staff were prompt and helpful, fixing issues quickly and offering good laundry service. Its location explains the competitive pricing. Yet, for visitors, I'd recommend spending slightly more for safer neighborhoods near attractions. Hotels in safer zones were just a bit pricier. In hindsight, I'd skip Sonder SF next time."

The neighborhood is very quiet which we liked, however a bit far from all of the touristy things to do in the city. Uber was easy to use though, so this wasn't a big deal for us.

Location walkable to Moscone Convention Center, though will agree that the homeless population residing on the street in front of the home was a turn-off. <br/>We did have trouble with communication with Sam during our stay, which was quite problematic due to the lack of heating when we checked in. I contacted Sam the morning after check-in to let him know the heating would not turn on and it was extremely cold. We had 2 young children including an infant with us, and this was a significant concern. Sam responded and was aware of the problem, but simply stated the home would take time to heat. I sent several follow-up messages explaining that the heating had not turned on in 10hrs and requested a phone or video call to help troubleshoot but he would only respond by message every 2-3hrs. We finally got the heating on after hours of changing settings on the Nest, while our kids spent the day at a nearby restaurant, but no thanks to Sam."

We loved walking to the park each day. We also enjoyed all the eateries on Balboa, just a block in the other direction. The 5 bus route is so convenient.<br/>As we stayed 3 months, we very much appreciated David’s help with little things that came up around the house. He worked very quickly to fix the internet after a storm knocked out power briefly and installed a latch for extra security on the back door to the patio. The place is well-furnished, with lots of seating options and an adorable old wooden desk that is perfect for remote work. The kitchen is functional, and David left a variety of helpful items to get us started so we didn’t have to run to the grocery store immediately to buy the essentials. The bathroom is great and newer washer/dryer were awesome!<br/>Thank you David!"

We were there for a tech conference and we were very happy with the interior space. The room with the double beds is quite spacious and it was great that it had its own bathroom. The living room furnishings were a little low for me as I am tall and have a bad knee, but it still felt cozy. I liked that we had all we needed. It was great that 711 was right across the street for a quick coffee and snacks! We stumbled upon a delicious Mexican cafe for a tasty breakfast burrito and there was a Columbian cafe a few doors down that we went to the next day for an even tastier breakfast burrito! Super delicious. <br/>The less than stellar aspects are it is street parking and I didn't factor that in. Three of us brought our cars so that was a nightmare. Two of us got in much later at night and drove for 45 minutes to find parking and they ended up sleeping in their car. Also there are a lot of steps which I wish I knew because of my knee."

It is placed in a great neighborhood on a nice quiet street that is surrounded by local coffee shops, restaurants, and corner stores. We found everything we needed around the neighborhood. The studio apartment layout feels spacious and comfortable even though it’s a smaller space. The ceiling height was a bit of a concern from staying at other lower/basement apartments in SF that were too shallow for my 6’4 tall partner. Jeff reassured us that the place had tall ceilings and he was correct. The place has very tall ceilings and a spacious bathroom. Everything about the place felt cozy and comfortable, and not like a sterile AirBnB. Getting in and out was very easy as well."

The location was ideal for those who want a true SF experience. Walkable, quiet, friendly, safe, etc. There was so much to do and I would recommend reading the guestbook for tips.

Beth and Don are wonderfully gracious hosts, very warm and attentive without at all being intrusive or overbearing. We shared great morning and evening conversations, and although I stayed for just three nights, when I left I felt like I was saying good-bye to old friends. Zoe is a super sweet lovable pup and contributed greatly to the joy of staying in their lovely home. The room and bathroom - the entire home - is kept very neat and clean, and while the bathroom is shared, I never once had a problem using it when I needed to. Beth and Don have obviously mastered the art/skill of being available for their guests while also providing for and respecting their privacy. This is a superb Airbnb for the solo traveler, located in a safe and fun San Francisco neighborhood, and I look forward to staying with Beth, Don and Zoe again in the future!"

My BF and I were looking for a place to stay in SF after a concert, and this spot was perfect.<br/>Interior-- Everything was awesome, no complaints. It's clear the host put a lot of thought into making everything comfortable. Furniture, towels, etc. felt brand new, and I noticed a lot of little extra touches here and there (space heaters, signage, lighting). I loved the giant windows!! It was lovely to fling open the curtains and enjoy the sunlight and trees.<br/>Exterior-- Very easy to find/access the house and entrance. Private back deck was lovely! Ample street parking. FYI, the property is on a hill. We opted to park 2-3 houses up the street where it was flat, since neither of us is good at parallel parking stick-shift on a slope. (It's actually not even that steep, but still, heads up for anyone reading this who can relate!)<br/>Location-- So peaceful and tranquil. Lots of trails nearby to go for walk/jog.

The location was walking distance to a lot of bars. Parking was $35 and you can park inside the gate and fence but there’s roughly about 7-10 parking spots inside. They do have a lot, but it is an open lot. Be careful with your belongings because of a shattered glass everywhere. I don’t think this is something the hotel can control as it is a problem for the city. The girl at the concierge desk was very very friendly. She provided helpful tips on how to stay safe and locations to see. The Hotel itself felt very safe in the neighborhood walkable. Overall, I felt like I had a very good experience with my stay."

The location is prime - it served as an excellent base for us to explore the city, and we truly appreciated the convenience it offered. The space was ample and comfortably accommodated our family.<br/>However, the property is a basement, which might not be to everyone's preference. Additionally, we felt the absence of a kitchen and oven. It would have added significant value to our stay had these been available, especially for those like us who prefer cooking at times.<br/>All in all, I'd recommend this place for its location and space, but do be aware of the basement aspect and the limited kitchen amenities."

Great if you want to be in the Union Square area, or on business in central downtown. <br/>My second time I have stayed - mainly because of location. <br/>Some gripes: not enough storage for clothes, you just get a few cardboard hangers and there is no proper rack or wardrobe.<br/>Also no bags storage - but can use a luggage shop on over side of the road. <br/>The sink is so low it’s great for kids, but for adults you risk pulling your back to use it. <br/>But, overall: great location, nice staff, easy to check in and out, very basic and limited decor and support in-room, but clean and modern.

The bed was so comfortable and I slept so well every night as was so peaceful. I will definitely be returning here as I couldn’t ask for any more for my stay here for 24 days in San Francisco. More than comfortable, and very grateful to have found this gem."

The check-in process was seamless. Our host took the time to ensure we had everything we needed and provided valuable local.<br/>The property itself was nothing short of spectacular. The house was immaculate and beautifully decorated, reflecting the vibrant and eclectic spirit of San Francisco. The attention to detail was evident in every corner, from the cozy living room to the well-equipped kitchen and comfortable bedrooms. The house was spacious enough to comfortably accommodate all four of us, and the amenities provided were top-notch.<br/>What truly set our host apart, though, was their genuine hospitality. They were always just a message away, ready to answer any questions or provide assistance. We felt like valued guests throughout our stay,"

Public transport is close. It's a huge flat with 3 bathrooms so we never had to wait. There are 2 livingrooms and a really nice garden (quite a few steps down, but it makes it even more special and exotic). We met the really friendly Jeffrey just once, but he checked by phone if we needed anything and offered his help. A nice lady cleans the flat regularly. Thanks you!"

We sat around for 45 min waiting for a response from the host, called Airbnb to get some help.  Finally after almost an hour a neighbor came out, with the lock box that had the keys.  Host didn't respond for another 30+ min about lost key. Not a great way to start out the trip.  <br/>Then to get groceries we went to Good Life Grocery (which we loved) but we did not have a car so to walk back up a steep hill for 1/2 mile with 2 young kids and 5 bags of groceries was A LOT of work! Then to top it off the coffee maker had mold in it.  Later in the trip we ran out of toilet paper.  We only had about 1.5 rolls for 4 people for 5 days.  When I asked the host about it, she responded that in the house rules it states we need to replace what we used and that this is common practice (looking over the house rules, I didn't see this stated anywhere!  <br/>Bus stops were inconvenient and the roads are steep to get up/down"

The hallway of to the room kinda had a weird smell, maybe from someone cooking downstairs, but it wasn't strong enough to really bother me. The location is very good. The SF cable car station is right in front, so I was able to get by with that most of the time. There's also a Trader Joe's 5 minutes away on foot, which is super convenient for getting breakfast or night snacks. The area immediately around the place is good, but there are some sketchy places couple blocks South. Besides that though, the area is pretty safe. Overall, a pretty nice place to stay!"

There were a lot of restaurants within walking distance for coffee, lunch, dinner, fresh fruit and transportation. Easy street parking. Everything was as described in photos but much nicer, very thoughtful with amenities including coffee, tea, wine opener. Extremely comfortable futon and bed. Nice pillows and linens for a very deep sleep. Extra towels were a plus. Would definitely stay again."

La vue du séjour est effectivement dégagée et agréable. La place de parking est un atout majeur. Nous avons eu quelques soucis de chauffage à notre arrivée suite à la tempête ainsi que des pannes d'électricité suite à des surtensions. Bryan a fait intervenir rapidement le  service de dépannage pour le chauffage. Pour les soucis électriques nous avons dû ouvrir l'armoire électrique et réenclencher des interrupteurs. Mais Bryan et Robert bien qu'à distance sont toujours restés disponibles pour nous guider. Mis à part ces quelques imprévus, nous avons apprécié l'appartement de Bryan et nous vous le recommandons. Le quartier Castro est agréable et le logement se trouve à 10 min à pied de la station Castro."

The listing is accurate and instructions were clear. The bedroom and bathroom were both spotless and had thoughtful touches like a wireless charger and makeup towel that few hosts think to add. The bed was comfortable and had more support than most hotel beds (I’m a consultant, so I’ve slept on my fair share). The kitchen is well-stocked and to-die-for, with plenty of dishes, silverware, cooking utensils, and top-of-the-line cookware that serious home chefs will appreciate. The host was responsive and helpful, even letting me store my suitcase there until the afternoon on the day I checked out, and the place definitely has a communal vibe. This is truly a gem and reminded me of the way Airbnb used to be when it was only a few years old. I coincided with the owner, Marcus, as well, and he deserves his own glowing review for outstanding hospitality. You won’t regret staying here."

Lyft and Uber drivers arrived quickly. We toured the city all day and it felt so nice to rest here at night. I was very concerned about the location, never having been to the city, but it was so safe here and the home is beautiful.  The home is by a freeway but you do not hear anything; very quiet and peaceful inside. I will say, the front door is completely glass which is a little uncomfy because people could see in but there is a steep stairwell which hides the door pretty well. <br/>Please stay here—you won’t regret it!!!10/10 would stay here again."

I loved all windows in the living room plus the balcony deck, and that everything feels clean and new. I had a hectic couple of days in the city and this spot was great to come back to and relax.

I had to repeat myself many times to be understood.  The internet started getting shaky, she had no solutions, and waited more than 2 weeks to buy a new router and clearly had no idea how it worked nor made any effort to get in touch with a pro. Worst of all, the apartments ventilation had been blocked up deliberately, which caused a major mold outbreak. And I now know it was not the first time, since I found a bottle of mold cleaner left there, but they never told me about the issue. After waiting several days, Carmina had someone enter my apartment without telling me, to ""fix"" the issue by using bleach, which I understand actually releases more spores.

Walk distance to the beach and nice Chinese restaurant. Running distance to golden bridge park.  San Francisco is amazingly charming. I love it every time I visit. One thing to mention is that it is literally next to the train/bus track. When the train passes, the noise is clearly heard with all windows closed and you can feel floor is shaking. The train operates from early morning 5/6 am to deep night. If you are used to city noise, train, you may be able to handle it. But I found it is very tough. During my stay, the central heater is broken. Daniel told me technician is working on that but parts will be not available during my stay. Daniel suggests me to use the portable heaters in the rooms instead. It is still super cold. Bad sleep+cold nights+travel, without surprise, my whole family fall sick. If you visit their house this winter, you may want to confirm the central heater is fixed."

We had room to work during the day and it was an ideal location for getting around the city by car. It has a pretty usable kitchen (except the circuits blew once), and the bathrooms were really nice and clean. It is so nice that he allows dogs, but it might not be an ideal location for dogs because there was no yard for the dogs to go out, which means we had to walk them several times during the day. It was raining a lot during our stay so we had to spend a lot of time toweling off dogs and Rory said that someone lives in the downstairs unit and we had to be pretty quiet, so we were a bit anxious about our dogs making too much noise, etc. If you have dogs you might want to find a more suitable location. Also be careful about the cost. It is advertised at $242.00 per night but with fees it was actually $418.00 per night. We did enjoy our stay though."

I had a late flight and didn't get in until 1 am and it was very easy to be let in (I had also made sure to contact them beforehand). The staff were always so nice, pleasant, and helpful. I also just felt very safe when I was inside the hostel, I feel like everyone is on the same page on that front. Also I felt like my stuff was safe too because the front door locked (after 9pm) and the bedrooms also need a pin to get in at any time, so at most only the others staying in your room would be around your stuff, but with a lock it felt that much safer. I used the bike rental deal they have with blazing saddles on the first day and that went just great. I also attended one of the social events they had on Friday night and made lots of friends that night, even one that I will continue to be friends with after going back home. I also really liked the location, it was a pretty good spot. Overall, I had a wonderful experience here! I recommend!"

The house itself is very tastefully furnished and the beddings , linens , bath supplies were par excellence. The Neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet but at the same time near to nice restaurants and central to most of the attractions in the city.

It wasn’t very clean (hair and dirt on the floor) and the pullout couch was missing a cushion so some of our guests had to squeeze on a bed. Victoria was very polite and a good communicator. Unfortunately, during our stay, the place flooded and we had to spend the entire day taking care of it and our stuff got damaged. The host offered a small compensation for the trouble, but the amount offered wasn’t sufficient for the troubles. Regardless, I would recommend this unit for a stay, but make sure it’s not raining in the area at that time."

I really appreciated that as Im one of those people who needs one in the background to sleep. Its on the corner by their  Chinatown and Little Italy so there was always delicious food around and lots of stores to shop at. The best part was its only a 15 min walk to our concert venue Bimbos 365 club and 15 min walk to the wharf so no having to pay for parking all over town.

But for the money, I would have liked a tiny bit more responsiveness and flexibility. For example: We had about three hours to kill before check-in, and it is very unsafe to leave anything in a parked car in San Francisco. (There are a lot of break-ins, even in broad daylight.) We messaged the host to ask if we could drop off our luggage early and never got a response. On our last day, we asked for more coffee cups (they had only provided three paper cups) and never got a response for that either. These are minor issues, but, again, this is a high-end unit in a sophisticated city.<br/>Finally, I got very sick with Covid while staying here and had to check out a day earlier than planned. Though the host is not obligated to refund me for the unused day, and I didn’t ask, I would have been so grateful if she had offered."

They have a ingenious idea of creating a luggage room for guests to place their suitcases before check in and check out times. They were flexible with our situation where we needed to come before the check in time. <br/>The room was clean and a good size. I think the prize is fair. They have a kitchen space where you can eat breakfast. The first lock was confusing, but they clarified everything when you asked. Overall, I recommend the place for a weekend stay."

The property has its own private entrance and private car space which was great. In terms of the property space itself, the space is quite functional and the bed was extremely comfortable, however, the overall property could use a bit of TLC, a lot of the furniture is on the older side and could do with replacing to make it more functional for the guests. Overall it was a good stay and the location was a great one to be in when exploring San Francisco. :)"

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of being woken by whoever lives upstairs at 6:23 AM in the morning by their radio. I don't know if the owner lives upstairs or other guests but it was a bit of an unfortunate jolt because I really needed as much sleep as possible before I caught my flight out. That being noted, I emailed Su via AirBnB and with in moments the radio stopped. So BIG APPRECIATIVE POINTS for PROACTION...just a bit confused as to whether or not guests/the owner are aware of how much the sound travels downstairs in the morning. Now I can't say for certain if I would have been woken if I wore ear plugs...which going forward I will always do when staying at AirBnB's so there is learning for me here too :) Apart from that...again...a true gem of a place."

Ashish was very responsive to my emails and questions! Even though it is right on a fairly main street, it wasn't loud in a way that disturbed my sleep at all!  The only caution I could say is that the mattress topper is a very thick memory foam (as advertised) - probably very comfy and cozy for lots of people, but for those that like a firmer sleep surface, like myself, the bed was a little uncomfortable.  But again, that was advertised, and I still slept fine. Would definitely recommend this place!"

I was especially grateful for the laundry and all of the supplies provided by Peter to make it an easy task. Peter was very responsive to my questions and one problem that arose.

Marianne was extremely kind and walked us through the check-in process in person and was always kindly checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed.

There are good restaurants and fun activities within at most 15-20 minutes no matter which direction you start walking. <br/>Some other useful notes: the parking space is a bit tight if you have a large car, but I fit a Subaru Outback with only a bit of careful effort; there is plenty of natural light, and the rising sun is indirect for late sleepers; the shower will start to lose heat after 10-15 minutes but if you turn it off and try again in a bit it will be hot again; and the hosts have done a great job at packing as much storage space as possible into the available area, so there is plenty of room for luggage.<br/>I stayed in this apartment for 10 weeks for a job in the financial district and had no issues. <br/>Would definitely recommend!"

The experience was easy, in part due to the host’s responsiveness, but also because all the details were clear up front (do read the house rules — it is so helpful and clear). The garden out back with the sun deck but also lovely clean hot tub are reason enough to rent — add to that a perfectly laid out interior space, and you have a great experience. The house is located on a road that ends after a short hill which was easy to walk, so it is very quiet.

After looking around the area for another place to stay, it was obvious that I needed to check availability for Peters place. I was very satisfied with my stay, the unit is very clean and in a safe area. You will enjoy being very close to restaurants, Golden Gate Park, and the Golden Gate Bridge.

Our check out time was 11AM. I even yelled and warned the person to not come in as there are people in the room and they still proceeded to! It invaded the privacy of my boyfriend and I. <br/>I proceeded to go upstairs and talk to John about this and he mentioned he would give us some credits back, yet when I messaged him about it, I got NO response. <br/>Overall, the room was pretty dusty, and the sheets/pillows had a bunch of lint on it. And the bed was very uncomfortable and too hard. The comforter was wayyyy too heavy, heavier than hotels. The mattress cover was not tucked properly under and it was stiff and wrinkly, it hurt to move my legs around."

I met her during my stay and she tried to help me as much as possible about the attractions and parking cautions. She even provided us muffins for breakfast!! She is very kind and try to make ourselves at home. Across the house, there is Grocery Outlet where you can buy some foods and drinks with reasonable prices. The neighbor seems quiet but the BART station area which is few minutes away by walk was somewhat scary at night. Parking could be challenging for those who plan to use cars. We could find a parking spot luckily whenever we came back to the house in the late afternoon but it may not be always the case. Brenda kindly offered us to park our car in her driveway after she went to work because the street parking is not allowed between 9 to 11 AM on MWF due to street cleaning. Overall, we recommend Brenda's house and she is a perfect host!!"

Great hosts who quickly responded to some questions we had. Check in was simple enough. Divisadero is a great place to be based. Easy to get buses to city centre or Fisherman’s Wharf, walkable to Haight Ashbury, Golden Gate Park. Being away from the tourist areas meant we saw more of San Francisco than if we’d stayed at Fisherman’s Wharf. Good selection of restaurants on Divisadero - expensive but that seemed to be the case with everything in SF. Great bagels from Schlok’s on Fell St. The Mill good for coffee and (expensive) bread.

The bathroom had all the amenities you need and probably forgot. The bed area was cozy with radiant floor heating. I was close to public transportation, restaurants, and  shopping. The grounds and house are neat and tidy and made you feel at home. Checking in and out was a breeze. Angelo was very responsive to my messages.

The walking closet was the size of another room. The bathroom was also very nice. Kitchen was modern stocked with coffee, teas, breakfast treats and some snacks. Overall great place to stay in the heart of downtown SF. The one thing to consider is that the apartment is at the top of a steep hill and apartments requires taking stairs.

En effet, dès notre arrivée, le soir vers 22h, des bruits de perceuse faisaient vibrer tout l'appartement. Finalement, beaucoup de bruit en journée ou le soir. Des bruits de pas venus des voisins d'au dessus. L'isolation phonique est quasi nulle et nous n'avons pas pu nous reposer. Idem du côté de l'isolation thermique, il fait très froid dans l'appartement, c'est finalement une partie du garage qui a été aménagé.<br/>Attention aussi, le petit plus de l'appartement, son vidéoprojecteur, fonctionne assez mal et j'ai du y brancher mon chromecast pour caster Netflix.<br/>Enfin, quelques soucis de saleté.

Super cool vintage elevator. Can be a little noisy, but it’s expected given the age of the building and the location - was not an issue at all.

The walk to the water is short and it’s lovely to take a stroll on the beach. It’s a perfect spot if you’re looking to visit San Francisco without wanting to be in the heart of city life because you come home to a quiet and peaceful spot, and can still access downtown San Fran easily by public transit. Makes for an easygoing time where you can stay in chill mode by the Airbnb or get out and have fun in the city proper. We stayed for a week and a half and the bed felt comfy the whole time! My husband and I are tall people and felt like there was plenty of space for us to feel comfortable for the longer stay. The hosts are also super friendly and helpful to make you feel at home.

Great area, beach is walkable and close to the SF Zoo and not too far of a drive to the Golden Gate Bridge. Host was very responsive to any questions as well. <br/>Some of the not-so-good: ants were in bedroom #1. Host came to clean it up asap, but we found more the next night (night before checkout) in a different room. Since we left early that morning, there was nothing the host could have done to fix the ant situation in bedroom #2. Additionally, the home does not have any AC - 2 fans were provided but when we walked into the home it was 84 degrees inside. Very hot. We came during abnormally warm weather, but still would have been nice to know AC is not in the home. <br/>Overall, I enjoyed the location and amount of space here. However, felt it’s not a “luxury” stay and more “bare minimum” in terms of the overall home."

Very pretty. Uncluttered. Great natural light. Nice garden. Private. Well appointed with everything you could need. Joan was a perfect host - proactive and friendly but not remotely intrusive. If someone asked me to be extremely picky, you can hear the lovely couple upstairs from time to time, but I didn’t find it bothersome at all. Never happened notably late or early and was just normal noise - muffled footsteps or a washer/dryer. Only sharing because I know some people are super sensitive to that — and if that’s you, this might not be your place. In my book - it’s a city, the apartment is central and there was no street noise, so who cares! A super deal overall. Will most definitely stay again!"

Apparently the family upstairs had a children's party. Cheryl apologized for not letting us know. The second night, a door knob malfunctioned, and it was on the door that led to the bathroom. That night, the wind and rainstorm caused the motion sensor outside the entry to light up repeatedly. The entry door has a glass panel at the top, and this made for difficult sleeping. Cheryl came the next day and put a cover over the glass. She also taped the door that led to the bathroom so that it wouldn't stick.

You will need to walk uphill because this is San Francisco, but everything eles makes this a good choice for couples or a single person visiting the city for a few days. You will be blessed with a partial view of the bay and I truly recommend jogging in the area. As expected in the US there is a Starbucks that is walkable.

It has mirrored furniture, which was kinda weird bc there are a lot of reflections but it was fine. Bed is kind of lumpy and the pillows were super uncomfortable. It has a good kitchen. The living room is nice and the couch is comfortable, but I wish  there was a table or something to set my computer or drinks down on. <br/>The apartment was generally warm and by opening the door I could get a nice cross breeze. <br/>Overall, super solid 2 months there for a summer internship.

The Airbnb was well-equipped with amenities with details to attention. The bedroom has a window that looks out to the backyard. Although I don't think guests have access to the backyard, it is quiet and private. The cozy space in front of the window makes for a perfect reading nook, and on occasion, one might catch a glimpse of a charming neighborhood cat lounging in the backyard. There were muni stops nearby the place and good restaurants/711 conveniently located within walking distance. The shower water pressure is great and extra towels are placed within the Airbnb.

The bedroom was even better than its photo and the bed was wonderful. There were plenty of towels and a spa-like array of bathrobes and slippers. The shared bathroom in the hall was close by and was kept in gleaming and spotless condition. Access to the kitchen was a real plus, and it reminded me of communal kitchens in some of the top-notch youth hostels in Australia. I appreciated having the ability to store food in a full-sized refrigerator, make coffee or tea, use the microwave or toaster oven, and use the dishware, etc. An added bonus was having access to the backyard garden. The thing that surprised me most was the quiet! The other guests were all polite, quiet, and respectful of one another's peace and quiet. Joy!"

The location was fantastic, with easy access to all the best sights and restaurants in San Francisco.<br/>But what really stood out was Giulio's charm and warmth as a host. From the moment I arrived, he went out of his way to make me feel welcome and comfortable. He safely provided some insider tips on local community services that I value as a solo foreigner transitioning to the area.<br/>The Airbnb itself was clean, cozy, and well-equipped, with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay.

The space is private and very homey - the linens were soft and the long blue pillow on the couch is the BOMB the softest decorative pillow ever. Having an entire en suite bathroom is also a giant plus. She also had a mini fridge and microwave which was great for utilizing leftovers - there was also a Nespresso and hot tea kettle for your morning rituals. It was rainy my trip so I wasn’t able to utilize the garden table and chairs but it always looked inviting. The neighborhood is safe and clean. The space is below the host’s living space so you do hear them throughout the day and sometimes at night but it isn’t a big deal if you don’t mind some floorboard creaks or bumps.

The unit was cozy and clean, and we were so happy to have a parking spot to use. <br/>Although much of our time was spent on the go in the San Francisco civic center, we did have the opportunity to explore Cheryl’s neighborhood on foot. The surrounding area is an eclectic mix of homes, retail shops, and places to eat.  It’s a true Bay Area experience; bustling and energetic. <br/>We had the pleasure of meeting Cheryl in-person for a brief chat. She’s friendly, warm, and she cares about her guests’ comfort. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay at her place again in the future. It’s a terrific alternative to an overpriced hotel or motel."

We had contemplated staying in Union Square for our visit this time. We were discouraged by the nightly parking rates and ""resort fees"" that every place was offering. It is in a great location where even from the couch you can people watch. We enjoyed opening the door/window and just taking in the city sounds....we don't have that back in Texas where we live. The place looks identical to the pictures, smells amazing and is very inviting. The parking was really a huge selling point for us because we not only could park but our car was secure from vandalism. Everything we needed was provided. I got a tad turned around on where to enter parking initially but Susie was quick to respond and help me out. I would definitely recommend this home over a hotel and will be staying here again in the future. Thanks Susie!!!"

It was mostly clean outside of a few dirty kitchen towels, a stain on a laundry hamper, and the rugs in the living room and bathroom needed to be cleaned when I arrived. The host was very responsive when I had issues with Wifi or needed items (e.g., a vacuum, blender). The location is nice, seemed relatively safe, and was easy to get around using public transportation. The building is on a very steep hill, which I imagine could be an issue for some people. The only really bad thing about this apartment is the unit is on the first floor, so it can be quite noisy at all hours of the day. The upstairs neighbors are also quite loud at times, even in the middle of the night. The other reviews mentioned the noise issue, so I was prepared, but if you're a light sleeper, I would reconsider. People walking on the street can definitely see into the apartment, so just have to be mindful of that."

The place is absolutely highly recommended—everything in San Francisco is easily accessible, with Lyft or Uber, as well as having your own car. In addition, I felt 100% safe at all times. The accommodation is really great—the view and the light through the sun and the open windows are absolutely breathtaking. You can park your car on the side of the road—I have always found a space. In addition, it is actually a huge plus that you can hear the family and Katie being there—it gives a sense of security, and you don't feel alone when traveling alone. You can't go wrong with choosing Katie's accommodation—you won't regret it. I will definitely be back!"

When I arrived a couple hours early than the check-in time, they had my room ready and welcomed me to drop my stuff off and get settled. Jun was thorough in orienting me with the house and instructing me how to get in and out.<br/>The home was immaculate and beautifully furnished. The private room was comfortable with a very firm bed, and the spa-like bathroom was well-appointed with Aesop hair and body care products and plush white towels. <br/>After driving around the block a few times, I was able to find a parking space nearby for the evening. I was familiar with the neighborhood, and felt safe.<br/>I will definitely keep Jun and Millo's place in mind for future stays in the citiy."

Spyglass Coffee was a hit, as was Marigold Cafe, and for Sunday morning we all went up to Toast on Church St. For our group of five it was handy to have the extra single bedroom, and the second half-bath is a perfect addition. Thanks, too, for the spotless cleaning and easy communication. Parking was not as difficult as we thought it would be, as we were able to find a place within a block at all times, but if staying multiple weekdays one might have to do a bit more moving the car around (but most locals seem to ignore parking restrictions so maybe it isn’t an issue).

The place was adorable and well decorated, we slept 5 comfortably! The location was convenient, but parking was pricey and kind of a headache. We drove down from Sonoma County and paid anywhere from $30 to $50 per car which is expected for SF, but the hassle was trying to find a spot nearby while cooperating with the restrictions on how long we could stay parked in one spot. If you can make it work, definitely leave the car at home and utilize Uber or Lyft instead!"

We loved every second of being there. It was the most perfect place for 2 people; easy check in, a small patio, perfect kitchen, beautiful bathroom, and the coziest living room and bedroom. My boyfriend was blown away upon walking in and we both fell in love with it instantly. The price point was so beyond worth it. The location was amazing, we were so close to everything we wanted to do, as well as being able to walk to the beach at night to see the sunset.

The unit itself is split level, which makes it feel bigger even though it's already a decent size. Bed and couch are comfy. Good TV options. Very large desk--great for WFH.  Kitchen is compact but very well stocked. As others have noted, the entranceway is very narrow and a bit awkward, and the unit is carpeted.

The Noe Valley area was the best San Francisco I have ever seen, very safe feeling to walk around. Nice houses and within a couple of blocked lots of small restaurants and boutiques, almost feeling like we were in southern Europe. From the house, we enjoyed great views to the Bay, Twin Peaks and other beautiful surroundings. House was quiet and nice, very roomy and well equipped. Modern art and books everywhere. This is not just an Airbnb house but a house where the hosts actually live. Very welcoming and responsive hosts. Too bad we didn’t have time to try the hot tub in the backyard. Also the downstairs neighbour seems to be really sensitive for noise - we are a very quiet and tidy group but carrying our luggage out on 1st morning on our way to work triggered the neighbour to complain to our hosts. On the brighter note, we did not get any traffic or other noise from outside/neighbours. Recommend! 🧡"

Nob Hill and within walking distance to Chinatown, Union Square, etc. I'm not a particularly fit person, but was still fine for me but as typical for SF, on a steep hill as are surrounding blocks.  Reception staff very nice. Currently no maid service (said it was due to COVID, but it seems most hotels have pretty much permanently cut out maid service). Odd requirement of turning your key in  if leaving building and getting your key back when you come back, but wasn't really a problem.  Place was clean and comfortable with a few small special touches.  Good sized kitchen.  No A/C - not a problem when I was here (May) but might something to pay attention to if renting in summer? My room had sliding door to nice little balcony/patio but I don't think they all do.    Uber cost from SFO was ~$30-40 depending on time of day.  Easy to catch uber around town - never had to wait more than 5min.  I didn't use local transport but many cable cars, buses seemed to stop near"

When we arrived, there was a very floral scent that was giving my husband a headache.  We went to lunch while Sven figured out what it was and removed it, then recleaned the bathroom for us.<br/>The only minor complaints we have are:<br/> there is no designated parking, so you have to hope that a spot on the street opens up.  This led to us not driving to do things as much as we planned.<br/>You can definitely hear Sven’s family upstairs.  I think the kitchen is directly above this unit based on the discussions about food we overheard.  Also, the back wall of this unit is inside their garage, so when they leave for work in the morning you will hear the car start and the garage door open and close.  We were already awake, so it wasn’t a big deal, but had we been trying to sleep in, it would have woken us up.<br/>Overall, this was a nice little place to relax.  There are good places to eat within walking distance."

Carved out of the ground/ garage level of a high bungalow-type residence, it was tastefully done and very clean. A ""junior"" suite, but perfectly adequate for my husband and me as we only slept and breakfasted there. The loveseat in the front room was comfortable for reading or watching TV. It's just a block north of Golden Gate Park with many buses on the east/west streets like Fulton and Geary. BART does not serve this area. The neighborhood was very quiet and seemingly safe. Many nice restaurants nearby. <br/>The kitchenette comprised a sink, a mini fridge with a freezer, an induction burner, a microwave, and a Keurig. We would certainly stay there again when we go to visit our son and his family who live close by. A forewarning for older or less mobile travelers...the shower is in a deep tub, which requires a very high step to get in and out of, and there are no grab bars. Comfortable bed though!"

But there were motion-sensored lights, and it seems like a reasonably safe neighborhood, so I had no issues!<br/>The apartment itself is fine for a quick trip. The decorations and furnishings are very outdated and could benefit from a refresh! The bed was not comfortable, but it did the job. You can easily fit a small family or two friends who don’t want to share a bed in this apartment if you plan on spending most of your time elsewhere!<br/>In terms of location, it’s clearly not near any offices or attractions, but I was able to find coffee!"

The house is shared with two more rooms but it is really quiet and private, there’s a kitchen where you can find anything you need if you want to cook something on the house or if you want to prepare a coffee, it is super clean. We loved the neighborhood where it is located, Mission is full of great restaurants , bars and stores. We went by car and we parked for our whole stay in a near parking, bc in SF you don’t really need a car to move around. We can’t recommend it more! great place in Mission !!"

While this may seem like an unfair comparison, it is not. Constructed by Philip's talented hands, their solidly-built, ground-level apartment is beautifully designed with the comfort of the traveler in mind—with a spacious and spotless kitchen with all necessary appliances, a cozy living room with a TV featuring a myriad of channels, a very nice bathroom, and an extremely quiet bedroom with a luxuriantly comfortable bed. The apartment is two blocks away from the nicest part of Golden Gate Park—with the De Young Museum, Japanese Tea Garden, and Conservatory of Flowers all an easy stroll away. It is also a five minute walk to the heart of ""Dim Sum Heaven""—a long stretch of excellent Asian dim sum restaurants and bakeries on Clement Street. Toni and Philip are extremely friendly and welcoming. As a veteran AirBnB user, I rate this AirBnB as amongst the very best in terms of overall value."

The bathroom and kitchen are shared with various people that are also staying in the air bnb. The other rooms in the house are occupied by other visitors so it almost feels like you’re staying in a dorm even though you have your own room. Parking was very difficult to find as well. When checking in, the host have a thorough tour of the place but he seemed a little too invasive. He told us info about other guests that should’ve remained private which made us feel uncomfortable. When we arrived, the room wasn’t quite ready yet so it was awkward to just stand there waiting for the room to be ready. For some people, this may be a good option. If you’re looking for something more private, I recommend look elsewhere."

The place is designed beautifully with tons of character while being cozy and modern. You’re walking distance from really great restaurants and it’s easy to get downtown. The bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in and the wifi was reliable, even with two people on zoom video calls for 6+ hours a day during the week. Parking during the week can be a little dicey since you have to move your car every 2 hours, but we were able to find a spot on a road without parking time limits, you just might need to plan to search for something that works. Jose was responsive, welcoming, and extremely helpful. Highly highly recommended! Thank you for having us!"

It's close to a muni train stop, the adjacent street has lots of restaurants and stores, including an amazing Chinese bakery with lots and lots of variety (I had breakfast there every day and never bought the same item twice) and is walking distance from Golden Gate park. I forgot to pack some basic things before I travelled, such as an umbrella and cufflinks, and the host was always willing to lend me theirs. All the basic amenities I needed were available. For the price I paid, the fact that I could do my laundry there at no extra cost (soap was provided), I could store food in the fridge, get water from the water dispenser, etc, I think this was a very good deal!"

They are very friendly and proactive and have great attention to detail in providing for their guests. As an extreme example, they provided 3 different kinds of soap in the bathroom for handwashing: bar soap, liquid soap, and foaming soap. I was amused when I saw it because it's a little over the top, but that should give you an example as to how detailed they are when thinking about what guests could need or want. <br/>The bedrooms were clean and the blankets were warm, we stayed during the winter and had no complaints. The location is very nice, with several restaurants within walking distance, and there is also a short hike up a nearby hill that offers beautiful views of the city. If you just need a simple place to sleep you could definitely find somewhere cheaper, but if you're looking for a place to enjoy and explore I would highly recommend this location."

It's animated by a variety of sounds: footsteps, mattress springs, toilet flushes...<br/>And where there's parquet, there's a ceiling... 6 floors of it!<br/>It's a pity, because the hotel is well placed, the surrounding neighborhoods are nice and the price is attractive.<br/>But you can't open a hotel with such damaged bedding.

The great room, looking out over the city, is so homey. I've been in well-photo-ed AirBnBs where the couches weren't actually sittable - these were so cozy. Bedrooms are all sizable and comfortable.

He thoughtfully allowed us to choose our own door code (so that it would be easier to remember) and was very responsive and kind. We really appreciated his thoughtful touches -- like allowing us to choose a complimentary wine and checking in to make sure we remembered to move our car for the weekly street cleaning.<br/>We asked if we could leave our packed luggage at the place for an hour after check-out (to allow us to do some things in the city in the morning), and Douglas was very accommodating.

Shared the house with a lovely couple, and my private room was clean and comfortable. Never had loud ruckus at night, so I slept very soundly on the massive bed. A bad storm knocked out the power for a day or two, but Mark and Sarah were extremely considerate of the situation, the downstairs couple even provided an extra blanket and flashlight!

Parking within the gate is extremely limited and on a first come basis so if you leave and someone takes your spot, you’re out of luck. There is a offsite lot available right next to the hotel.  The $35 parking gets charged additional fees and taxes so the total cost ended up almost double ($60)!<br/>The room was fine.

The apartment is well equipped, nicely decorated and overall as mentioned in the description. The had breakfast and sometimes dinner at the apartment. The kitchen could use some more cutlery and dishes depending on the amount of cooking you do. But that’s very individual / subjective I believe. Keep in mind that there is another apartment / room next to yours which seems to be rented out. Some days there was a little girl living next door, who was very noisy in the morning.

Questions are referred to local staff.  Everyone was SUPER nice!  We picked up our rental car a day early & they were able to accommodate us with a parking space last minute.  The parking is very secure (no outside access to the vehicles) but there is limited space so look into it ahead of time however, once you provide your info to Bianca, you can no longer cancel your AirBnB booking.<br/>We specifically hunted for a place with a rooftop patio so that we could watch the 4th of July fireworks (we're not big on crowds for such events) and it worked perfectly.  There is a 30 person occupancy for the rooftop so we got there early. <br/>They will assign your room upon arrival & priority will go to owners so if it's a full house, you'll likely not get a room with a balcony.  The bedroom window lets in a lot of light in so bring an eye mask if that's a problem for you.  <br/>Would definitely stay again!!"

We got married on February 1st and the weather / day was just perfect! Danielle’s place is decorated so beautifuly and super clean! We were able to take wedding day getting ready photos as well as portraits that are going to turn out fantastic! I love the vibes here! You truly will feel like home! The suite is accessible to a lot of great restaurants, little corner stores, market stores and a super cute candy store, even a nearby post office which we needed so that was super convenient for us! The location is easy to find for Uber. It was a little hard entering the front door but once you evaluate you’ll have no issues. <br/>Danielle was just amazing! So caring, sweet and genuine! She helped any way that she could and we had an absolute amazing experience here! Don’t forget to look at /fill out the guest book if you do decide to stay here! 😊 <br/>We thank you! We LOVE San Francisco!"

There were clear check-in instructions and a nice book full of recommendations along with the rules. There was a fully equipped mini kitchen that was very useful. <br/>As a basement studio, there was a bit of a damp smell and a few molding spots around the livingroom windows. A quick wipe and opening up the windows a bit before guests arrive would fix this though. The only real bummer was that the water pressure was non-existent. There was also a single pump in the shower with the same substance that was in the hand washing pump. A few little bathroom amenities would add to the experience.  <br/>Overall for a night or two, the studio will do the job!"

I gave them permission & then received an automated message the device had been removed & owed them $250 dollars. The second full day I was there, they wanted to enter my room again to put the monitoring device back- after the day before I was not about to let anyone in my room.  This was a non emergency situation & I have no idea why this couldn’t be accomplished around my reservation.<br/>Secondly, the heaters in the room make loud popping noises around 6:15am.

Quiet, cozy, comfortable and spotlessly clean, in a beautiful neighborhood that is close to both public transportation and car travel arteries.  We slept very soundly and had everything we needed.  Tyler responded very quickly and helpfully to any questions we had, and also anticipated our needs (like letting us know where to find extra blankets on a stormy evening).  We really appreciated how well stocked the studio was with snacks, coffee and toiletries.  The neighborhood is beautiful, too - Glen Park is a bit of a hidden nook in SF, where the true character of the city comes out in the neighborhood's hilly, curvy streets and special views towards the south and the east.  The studio is also a quick walk down the hill to La Corneta, which serves some of the best burritos in SF.  It is also a super quick Uber ride to SFO, which we appreciated when it came time to depart."

The space was well designed, beautifully furnished, and well equipped for our family of four people. It was easy to get in and out of the home using the electronic door entry, the amenities offered were just as detailed on her listing and the beds all slept very comfortably. For those who might be concerned, finding nearby (and safe) street parking was plenty easy enough and the neighborhood felt very safe and calm (plus, so many lovely shops and eateries just a few walking blocks away!).

The road noice was not too bad, the weather was friendly enough for a fan but could be a bit warm for hotter days.

Walking distance to the Castro, and there’s also a really wonderful park/hill (Corona Heights Park) with a look out of the city which is just breathtaking.<br/>It was my mom‘s birthday, and they left a card and a bottle of wine for her, which was really sweet and made her feel really special. We were also able to bring our little dog Rosie, which was a huge plus.<br/>I would say that the futon in the living room is not comfortable, I think it is fine for kids or folks who are fine roughing it a little bit, but for those of us who are used to soft beds it will be a downer.<br/>Overall, we had a really nice stay, thanks everyone!"

It actually has two features that many rentals don’t have in SF - a legit kitchen (with plenty of cookware) and a parking space in the driveway. I stayed with my 5 and 7 year old and we loved it. Plenty of space for us and very comfortable - it has a cozy feel. Also, Emma and William are extra welcoming and make an effort to make guests feel at home.

We also had a space for one extra car, which was amazing! We were very happy to be able to do laundry since we were there for 7 nights. There was plenty of extra bedding and supplies and everything was accessible. A few times, we relaxed by either playing games or creating a theater space in the largest bedroom. This was especially nice with our two grandchildren. Having access to the space outside in the back was also great. Yvonne was incredibly responsive, patient, and gracious!

Also the ad said the owners, who live upstairs, are a quiet family so guests should be quiet after 10pm.

It's very much a home away from home, spacious, gracious and with every possible amenity, including practical but beautiful furnishings (such as very comfortable beds, linens, and sitting/working areas) as well as art and books enlivening almost every room.  In a ""real"" though higher-end neighborhood (only a block from Sea Cliff and a mile or two from the tourist and downtown crowds), it's still readily accessible by car, public transport or bike to most areas of the city, but on the ""cool"" side of town, where the natural air conditioning keeps the air fresh and invigorating even in July.  This quieter side of the city (my favorite) has easy access to SFO, Marin, Golden Gate Park, the Presidio and Lands End, with all their walking trails, museums etc., as well as the Clement St shopping and dining district.  Free parking spaces, a quietly beautiful and private back patio, and a responsive and locally expert host complete the picture."

Had basically everything that I needed throughout my stay from the beginning(including cleaning supplies).👍🏼<br/>Apartment was quiet. Upstairs neighbor could get a bit loud sometimes (they had just moved in). Their volume wasn’t offensive, just worth mentioning for a balanced review of the unit. It wasn’t a problem for me. <br/>Neighborhood is slightly north of the tenderloin so I generally felt quite safe walking. Police patrolled. No homeless tents on bush street. And if one popped up it was gone within a day or two.  <br/>The building is very secure and safe. <br/>I Will stay here again."

The blanket and pillow definitely had some smell and I am not sure whether they were cleaned before me staying there. <br/>6) Bathroom: The shower head handle was not stable so all the time I had to hold it while taking shower. It is a split bathroom so the toilet is in another room. The toilet room definitely smelled but what to say when the place has 1 bathroom for like 5-6 guest rooms."

My sister and I booked the two separate rooms for one night while we were touring SF. We were arriving early and Minhao offered us to check-in early. Check-in was easy and the rooms were nicely set-up and decorated, as well as clean (although there were old blinds and boxes on the floor in my sisters room). The bathrooms were clean, although we did not use the shower, nor did we use the kitchen so I can't speak to that. The neighborhood has many cute restaurants/cafes within a few blocks. It's on a side street, so it was fairly peaceful. Only reason I am leaving a 4 star review is that the night we stayed (Wed) was trash/recycling/compost morning and we were both woken up several times in the middle of the night/early AM due to trash pickers and trucks picking up refuge, which is quite loud. Needless to say we were exhausted the next day due to this. It would be have been great to have sleep machines, fans, or air filters to block out the noise."

Verder ontbreken hier en daar de instructies, moet je wat puzzelen hoe oven, magnetron etc. werken.

Her suite was cozy - the beds and pillows were the right kind - we put our heads on them and fell into restful sleep. Her garden is good to spend time in and her cats are sweet. Gigi's breakfast options for is Vegetarians were thoughtful and perfect. We will definitely return to Gigi's place if we return to SFO.<br/>Just a heads-up - take the warning of not leaving anything in your vehicle seriously. This did not happen at Gigi's place and we should have dropped off our luggage at Gigi's which she had allowed. We had daytime tickets for the Exploratorium and decided to just visit there first. Our rental was broken into and they had enough time to take all our luggage. We were blessed that a good Samaritan found our suitcases and our basic stuff was untouched, however our laptops, gifts for family and other items from our bags were taken.

I was alone and clearly heard someone try my door (that had a sign with my name on it). There was another door from the bathroom that led to a corridor and couldn't be locked from the inside (it appeared closed but I couldn't be sure someone wouldn't open it during the night). I think this is not a safe place for a woman travelling alone. The host also made me enter through a very dirty and unkept back door instead of the front of the house, which sincerely made me nervous to begin with. To top it off, free parking was offered but was not available. After 2 hours of parking your car gets towed. You can only park from 9pm to 6am so you cannot leave your car there during the day. I ended up leaving anyways after the guy staying there tried my door and didn't spend the night. I didn't get a refund, but I would gladly abandon this place again to feel safe and be able to sleep at night. A nightmare booking."

We stayed for a month since our home was undergoing renovations and we felt right at home. Our kids had loads of fun and we particularly enjoyed the bidet and massive walk in closet. We were even able to store our plants, stroller and coolers right outside on the deck. Black out shades were awesome for naps. Loads of towels and linen. King bed was comfortable and fit all 4 of us. Hot plate was easy to work and there was plenty of storage in the quaint kitchen. Husband and I were able to do WFH. Parking right out front, and hour parking ample on the quiet neighborhood street, rare for SF. Hosts were extremely responsive and proactive. Our tv didn’t work and they replaced it same day. They were also flexible with our check in and out times, enough for us to haul our month worth of boxes and toys. Extremely cheerful and helpful hosts. Zero complaints.

Upon my arrival, Charlie courteously greeted myself and my significant other.  He let me know what to do and what not to do to ensure we were safe and comfortable.  There was an awesome folder in our guest room that had a warm greeting put together by Lainie I presume, and in the folder were recommendations for local activities and eateries.<br/>I got to meet Lainie on my last day out and she was a breath of fresh air!  She was extremely charismatic and caring and always kept in touch with me throughout the weekend to make sure we were good.  Very fun and easy to talk to.<br/>The Airbnb rental itself was just as described.  It had everything I was looking for and needed.  Perfectly advertised to a T.<br/>10/10 I would stay again if I ever returned to San Francisco again and needed to rent a pad to stay at.<br/>Thank you Lainie & Charlie."

We woke up every morning and had coffee on the little deck that looked over San Francisco.  It was one of our favorite things.  There were so many special touches throughout the house including fresh flowers in every room. It really made us  feel so welcome.

It's a hostel, but for a hostel, everything is very good. The location is very close to Union Square, everything is nice, neat, and the team has been helpful at every turn. If I had a conference to attend again nearby, I would come again without thinking twice.<br/>Yes, there is a problem with homeless people in SF (too few people care about them, especially the truly well-off folks who could make a difference), but that's not Orange Village's fault.

An Uber was easy enough to head into the city core - we found driving in the SF core and during rush hour a little overwhelming so opted to Uber in those scenarios. It was really handy to have garage parking at Edmund’s. <br/>Overall, this was a wonderful place to stay, and we wouldn’t hesitate to come back when we return to SF!"

There are lots of places close by to eat and order from so it wasn’t a problem. The park across the street is a huge plus with a swimming pool and tennis courts. It’s really close to the lovely Golden Gate Park with a museum, botanical garden and a museum. It’s great for a short stay like I had and the complimentary Nespresso helped me beat the jet-lag.

As other reviews have said there is a bit of noise from the freeway and it is a cooler ground-floor space but the hosts have thoughtfully placed a sound machine and space heater, alongside other comforts like warm blankets. This is in a beautiful neighborhood and located near many spots including Magic Coffee and Donuts, Phil’s, Whole Foods, Live Sushi, Two Son’s Sandwiches, and a cute stretch of 18th St with tons of eateries and some lovely shops. Downtown, The Mission, and the Dogpatch are not far. There are also several park spaces right there. Would recommend to anyone looking for a unique SF experience.

He was so accommodating, thorough, and friendly! <br/>I do have to emphasize that you must generally be a quiet person if you want to respect your neighbors in this building. I am able to hear the neighbors walking around and it helped me understand how quiet I need to be when I roam around and speak out loud especially when it's nighttime.

Also great is the heating/air conditioning system which is very fast and super functional.<br/>However, I rate less positively the condition of the kitchen in particular and the incredibly creaky bed in one of the bedrooms. We knew from the photos and previous reviews that we were not going to a state-of-the-art apartment with the latest amenities. However, the condition of the kitchen and some of its equipment was really in worse shape than I expected.

Location of the hotel itself is decent though, about a 10 minute walk from Pier 39."

Everything listed is true. <br/>- Room 404 is on 4th floor, I experienced 'elevator broke down' first day in. Stair was the way to go.<br/>- Room is right against the street. While enjoying the city view, there's also city noise, city screamers, or city traffic. If you are not used to the city setting and these kind of noise. Just making a note.<br/>- Room contains a mobile radiator for warmth, but no fan or cooling system. Opening the window was what I did. San Fran's weather was nice during my stay. <br/>- Calling or stopping by in person to communicate might be the best format. Hotel is not active on AirBnb message board. - the least not for my stay.<br/>- The room did received Weekly Cleaning service- which I did not anticipate. lol I did not mind since the house keeper did a great job changing the sheets, new towels, and organized my clothes which were on the bed.

We could get anywhere in SF within 15-30 minutes. Nice neighborhood that would be very walkable to some; except the hills were a little much for us. 18th Street has some great restaurants - Parker Potrero, Plow, Umi Sushi and Mochica are just a few. Good Life Grocery and Whole Foods are nearby too. Katie helped me figure out some of the parking in SF - it can be tricky. Just a perfect stay for us!"

The courtyard was a nice place to relax and have coffee in the morning. <br/>The place was in a nice and quiet area of town.  We felt safe leaving our car here and despite a lot of cars in the area, we never were more than a 20 yards away from our place when finding a place to park. <br/>The area is a bit of a drive, 25-30min. depending on traffic to tourist spots like the wharf but having it be quiet & safe was worth it. <br/>We eat halal & there was a nice chinese food restaurant not too far away that served halal, so that was a lovely surprise. <br/>We would definitely stay here again.

The place is  just blocks away from the Golden Gate park which made it very accessible for us to walk around during the morning. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet, and it’s away from the hustle of the usual touristy places.

Josh also let us drop our bags off early so we could enjoy the city for the day without worrying about our luggage. We did not realize how quaint the Courtland Ave area of Bernal Heights was and we wish we would have found that and explored that area more.<br/>What we did not love was how long it took to get to the big city area. If taking the public transit (Muni) it was only $2.50 per trip but took at least 45 minutes to get to or from the city, sometimes longer. If taking Uber, it was $20-30 per trip but only 20-25 minutes. Being on the south side of town, most tourist/fun attractions are on the opposite side of the city. We knew this ahead of time but didn't realize would take so long to get there. Renting a car is an option but there are few parking options in the city and paid parking would get a little more expensive."
