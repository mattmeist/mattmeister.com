Online reviews are a decent source of unintentional comedy online.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# List of images and captions (keep aligned by row)
reviews <- tibble::tibble(
  img = sprintf("reviews_hof/%03d.png", 1:10),
  context = c(
    "Thank you to Megan Weber for this!",
    "I would hate to see the rating if this had been a real issue.",
    "Is it better that they didn't replace the T with a +?",
    ' ',
    'The quotes around "vaccine" are a nice touch.',
    "Uhhhhhh.",
    'I am troubled by the fact that "The Hamburger Stand" remembered all but the burger.',
    'Full marks for "ease of use" though, so that\'s good.',
    "But I can't imagine it's any good",
    "Get those signs and words out of my face"
  )
) |> dplyr::slice_sample(n = 10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Render each review with matching image and context
reviews |>
  purrr::pwalk(function(img, context) {
    cat(glue::glue('
<div class="text-center my-5">
  <img src="{img}" alt="review" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <p><em>{context}</em></p>
</div>
'))
  })
```
